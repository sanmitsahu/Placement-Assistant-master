<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Border Gateway Protocol advertises, learns and chooses the best paths inside the global Internet. When two ISPs connect, they typically use BGP to exchange routing information. Enterprises also sometimes uses BGP to exchange routing information with ISPs, allowing the Enterprise routers to learn Internet routes. when we have multiple Internet connections and we want to influence some packets to take one path and some packets to take another we use BGP.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>BGP uses two mechanism to prevent loops:-</p>
<ol>
<li>When a router learns routes from an iBGP peer, that router does not advertise the same routes to another iBGP peer.</li>
<li>By using AS_PATH - When advertising to an eBGP peer, a BGP router adds its own ASN to the AS_PATH. If a BGP router receives an update and the route advertisement lists an AS_PATH with its own ASN, the router ignores that route.</li>
</ol>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><ol>
<li>Idle - The BGP process is either administratively down or waiting for the the next retry attempt.</li>
<li>Connect - The BGP process is waiting for the TCP connection to be completed. If it is successful, it will continue to the OpenSent state. In case it fails, it will continue to the Active state.</li>
<li>Active - BGP will try another TCP three-way handshake to establish a connection with the remote BGP neighbor. If it is successful, it will move to the OpenSent state.</li>
<li>Opensent - The TCP connection exists, and a BGP Open message has been sent to the peer, but the matching Open message has not yet been received from the other router.</li>
<li>Openconfirm - An Open message has been both sent to and received from the other router. Next step is to receive a BGP Keepalive message (to confirm that all neighbor-related parameters match) or a BGP Notification message (to learn that there is some mismatch in neighbor parameters).</li>

<ol>

<li>Locally injected routes - Locally injected routes (routes injected using network command) are better than iBGP/eBGP learned.</li>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The weight attribute is a Cisco proprietary attribute that is used in the path selection process when there is more than one route to the same destination. A path with the Higher weight value is preferred. The default value for weight is 0. The weight attribute is local to the router and is not propagated to any BGP peers.

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques18"><strong>Question 19. Types Of Bgp Routing Table?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Till now we all believe that BGP is having only a single routing table where it used to store the routes and process for the best path calculation. But we all are mistaken here actually BGP maintains three table one for storing incoming routes from neighbours, one for sending the routes to neighbours and one for installing the routes where you actually find the routes with next-hop address. The tables are given below:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Adj-RIB-in</li>
<li>Adj-RIB-out</li>
<li>Loc-RIB</li>
</ul>
<p>Adj-RIB-in stores the unprocessed information received from its peers. Here the best path selection occurs as per BGP attributes and after conformation path is entered into the local bgp table i.e Loc-RIB. From the local RIB table it conform the next-hop address if it reachable by IGP then the route is entered into the main routing table. </p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques19"><strong>Question 20. What Do You Mean By Mpls? What Are The Benefits Of Using Mpls?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>This is one of the most common questions asked during the MPLS interviews, so this question must be prepared for before facing the interview. Here you should start answering by introducing MPLS.</p>
<p>Multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) offer a mechanism to process packets on the basis of labels. It is a data forwarding service that provides high-end network communications from one network node to the next on the basis of labels rather than routing table lookups. Routing table lookup for each packet makes communication sluggish but MPLS uses LFIB/forwarding table to process label from one node to another.</p>
<p>The main benefits of using MPLS are:</p>
<ul>
<li>QoS integration: supports multiple levels of QoS, to manage latency, jitter and packet loss for various types of traffic (voice, video, email, bulk file transfers, etc.)</li>
<li>Fast convergence: label-based switching, no need to look up routing tables</li>
<li>Scalability to IP VPNs</li>
<li>Low network congestion using MPLS TE</li>
<li>Reliable and secure</li>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques24"><strong>Question 25. What Are Lib And Lfib? If We Disable Cef (on A Cisco Device) Will Mpls Work?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The difference between two is almost like RIB and FIB, as RIB uses FIB to forward traffic. Label Information Base (LIB) is a table where prefix to label bindings are built and stored in the control plane and can be seen with “show mpls ldp bindings.” Label Forwarding Information Base (LFIB) is another MPLS table used to forward label packets throughout the MPLS network and build in the data plane. To check LFIB, run “show mpls forwarding-table.” The lookups are in fact done in the LFIB, not the LIB.</p>
<p>If CEF is disabled, MPLS will not work, as it uses LFIB to forward labeled packets and LFIB built from the FIB table.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>This happens when we configure BGP on a router that has non-IP interfaces, meaning that if a router’s interfaces are not configured with any IP address, then BGP cannot get the router-id. In that case, BGP assumes 0.0.0.0 as router-id.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>If BGP peer is in idle state, then it could be due to physical connectivity failure or the neighbor is not defined properly with respective AS. In connect state, BGP tries to establish a TCP session over port number 179; if it fails to establish the connection, then it goes to active state, where it tries again to establish a TCP connection. By using “debug ip bgp” and “debug ip tcp transactions” commands, we can learn the exact cause of TCP connection failure. Lack of the “update-source” or “ebgp-multihop” command can also be a reason of neighbor active state.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques28"><strong>Question 29. Explain Bgp Recursive Lookup And Site Of Origin (soo)?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>BGP recursive lookup involves the router looking up the BGP route and BGP next hop to reach a destination in the remote AS. Then the router will look up the route into IGP to reach the BGP next hop. This mechanism is known as BGP recursive lookup.</p>
<p>BGP site of origin (SoO) is a loop prevention technique in the MPLS backbone environment. BGP SoO is associated with a CE-neighbor; that’s why whenever the PE router advertise a prefix to a CE neighbor, it check the SoO of the prefix with the SoO of the BGP neighbor to avoid loops.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques29"><strong>Question 30. What Do You Understand By Bgp Split-horizon Rule?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>This rule states, “Network prefixes learned from an iBGP peer will not be shared with another iBGP peer” to prevent routing loops. BGP uses the AS_PATH attribute to avoid routing loops, which means a route will not be accepted if the AS_PATH contains the same AS number of the router where it is receiving.

BGP communities’ information can be shared with a neighbor by using the command “neighbor x.x.x.x send-community standard | extended | both” and can be applied using route-maps to a defined neighbor. Some well-known BGP communities are:</p>
<p>Local-AS: Share the prefixes with iBGP-confederation peers only.</p>
<p>No-Advertise: Do not share the prefixes with anyone.</p>
<p>No-Export: Do not share the prefixes with another Global AS, share within the Public-AS only.</p>
