<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques0"><strong>Question 1. What Is Latch Up?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Latch-up pertains to a failure mechanism wherein a parasitic thyristor (such as a parasitic silicon controlled rectifier, or SCR) is inadvertently created within a circuit, causing a high amount of current to continuously flow through it once it is accidentally triggered or turned on. Depending on the circuits involved, the amount of current flow produced by this mechanism can be large enough to result in permanent destruction of the device due to electrical overstress (EOS).</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques1"><strong>Question 2. Why Is Nand Gate Preferred Over Nor Gate For Fabrication?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>NAND is a better gate for design than NOR because at the transistor level the mobility of electrons is normally three times that of holes compared to NOR and thus the NAND is a faster gate.</p>
<p>Additionally, the gate-leakage in NAND structures is much lower. If you consider t_phl and t_plh delays you will find that it is more symmetric in case of NAND ( the delay profile), but for NOR, one delay is much higher than the other(obviously t_plh is higher since the higher resistance p mos's are in series connection which again increases the resistance).</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The delay can be reduced by increasing the power supply but if we do so the heating effect comes because of excessive power, to compensate this we have to increase the die size which is not practical.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>In general multiple MOS devices are made on a common substrate. As a result, the substrate voltage of all devices is normally equal. However while connecting the devices serially this may result in an increase in source-to-substrate voltage as we proceed vertically along the series chain (Vsb1=0, Vsb2 0).Which results Vth2&gt;Vth1.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>In MOSFET, current flow is either due to electrons(n-channel MOS) or due to holes(p-channel MOS) - In BJT, we see current due to both the carriers.. electrons and holes.

In Cmos Technology, In Digital Design, Why Do We Design The Size Of Pmos To Be Higher Than The Nmos.what Determines The Size Of Pmos Wrt Nmos. Though This Is A Simple Question Try To List All The Reasons Possible?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>In PMOS the carriers are holes whose mobility is less[ aprrox half ] than the electrons, the carriers in NMOS. That means PMOS is slower than an NMOS. In CMOS technology, nmos helps in pulling down the output to ground ann PMOS helps in pulling up the output to Vdd. If the sizes of PMOS and NMOS are the same, then PMOS takes long time to charge up the output node. If we have a larger PMOS than there will be more carriers to charge the node quickly and overcome the slow nature of PMOS . Basically we do all this to get equal rise and fall times for the output node.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>In Transmission Gate, PMOS and NMOS aid each other rather competing with each other. That's the reason why we need not size them like in CMOS. In CMOS design we have NMOS and PMOS competing which is the reason we try to size them proportional to their mobility.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><ul>
<li>In digital design, decide the height of standard cells you want to layout.It depends upon how big your transistors will be.Have reasonable width for VDD and GND metal paths.Maintaining uniform Height for all the cell is very important since this will help you use place route tool easily and also incase you want to do manual connection of all the blocks it saves on lot of area.</li>
<li>Use one metal in one direction only, This does not apply for metal 1. Say you are using metal 2 to do horizontal connections, then use metal 3 for vertical connections, metal4 for horizontal, metal 5 vertical etc...</li>
<li>Place as many substrate contact as possible in the empty spaces of the layout.</li>
<li>Do not use poly over long distances as it has huge resistances unless you have no other choice.</li>
<li>Use fingered transistors as and when you feel necessary.</li>
<li>Try maintaining symmetry in your design. Try to get the design in BIT Sliced manner.</li>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p><strong>Metastable state:</strong> A un-known state in between the two logical known states.This will happen if the O/P cap is not allowed to charge/discharge fully to the required logical levels.</p>
<p><strong>One of the cases is:</strong> If there is a setup time violation, metastability will occur,To avoid this, a series of FFs is used (normally 2 or 3) which will remove the intermediate states.</p></p>
