<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The JDK 1.02 event model uses an event inheritance or bubbling approach. In this model, components are required to handle their own events. If they do not handle a particular event, the event is inherited by (or bubbled up to) the component's container. The container then either handles the event or it is bubbled up to its container and so on, until the highest-level container has been tried.</p>
<p>In the event-delegation model, specific objects are designated as event handlers for GUI components. These objects implement event-listener interfaces. The event-delegation model is more efficient than the event-inheritance model because it eliminates the processing required to support the bubbling of unhandled events.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques185"><strong>Question 186. What's Java Swing?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Swing is basscially a type of Toolkit which is  GUI toolkit for Java. It is one part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC). Swing includes graphical user interface (GUI) widgets such as text boxes, buttons, split-panes, and tables.<br/>
Swing widgets provide more sophisticated GUI components than the earlier Abstract Window Toolkit. Since they are written in pure Java, they run the same on all platforms, unlike the AWT which is tied to the underlying platform's windowing system. Swing supports pluggable look and feel ï¿½ not by using the native platform's facilities, but by roughly emulating them. This means you can get any supported look and feel on any platform. The disadvantage of lightweight components is slower execution. The advantage is uniform behavior on all platforms.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques199"><strong>Question 200. What Is The Difference Between Jfc &amp; Wfc? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>JFC supports robust and portable user interfaces. The Swing classes are robust, compatible with AWT, and provide you with a great deal of control over a user interface. Since source code is available, it is relatively easy to extend the JFC to do exactly what you need it to do. But the number of third-party controls written for Swing is still relatively small.<br/>
WFC runs only on the Windows (32-bit) user interface, and uses Microsoft extensions to Java for event handling and ActiveX integration. Because ActiveX components are available to WFC programs, there are theoretically more controls available for WFC than for JFC. In practice, however, most ActiveX vendors do not actively support WFC, so the number of controls available for WFC is probably smaller than for JFC. The WFC programming model is closely aligned with the Windows platform.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques201"><strong>Question 202. How Is The Mvc Design Pattern Used In Struts Framework? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>In the MVC design pattern, application flow is mediated by a central Controller. The Controller delegates requests to an appropriate handler. The handlers are tied to a Model, and each handler acts as an adapter between the request and the Model. The Model represents, or encapsulates, an application's business logic or state. Control is usually then forwarded back through the Controller to the appropriate View. The forwarding can be determined by consulting a set of mappings, usually loaded from a database or configuration file. This provides a loose coupling between the View and Model, which can make an application significantly easier to create and maintain.  Controller--Servlet controller which supplied by Struts itself; View --- what you can see on the screen, a JSP page and presentation components; Model --- System state and a business logic JavaBeans.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The Action Class is part of the Model and is a wrapper around the business logic. The purpose of Action Class is to translate the HttpServletRequest to the business logic. To use the Action, we need to Subclass and overwrite the execute() method. In the Action Class all the database/business processing are done. It is advisable to perform all the database related stuffs in the Action Class. The ActionServlet (commad) passes the parameterized class to Action Form using the execute() method. The return type of the execute method is ActionForward which is used by the Struts Framework to forward the request to the file as per the value of the returned ActionForward object.</p></p>

It can be use to validate the data on the users browser as well as on the server side. Struts Framework emits the java scripts and it can be used validate the form data on the client browser. Server side validation of form can be accomplished by sub classing your From Bean with DynaValidatorForm class. The Validator framework was developed by David Winterfeldt as third-party add-on to Struts. Now the Validator framework is a part of Jakarta Commons project and it can be used with or without Struts.

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques219"><strong>Question 220. Why Do We Need Struts? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Java technologies give developers a serious boost when creating and maintaining applications to meet the demands of today's public Web sites and enterprise intranets. Struts combines Java Servlets, Java ServerPages, custom tags, and message resources into a unified framework. The end result is a cooperative, synergistic platform, suitable for development teams, independent developers, and everyone in between.</p></p>
</li><br><br><li class="quesans mb-20">
<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques220"><strong>Question 221. How Does Struts Work? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Java Servlets are designed to handle requests made by Web browsers. Java ServerPages are designed to create dynamic Web pages that can turn billboard sites into live applications. Struts uses a special Servlet as a switchboard to route requests from Web browsers to the appropriate ServerPage. This makes Web applications much easier to design, create, and maintain.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques221"><strong>Question 222. Is Struts Compatible With Other Java Technologies? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Yes. Struts is committed to supporting industry standards. Struts acts as an integrator of Java technologies so that they can be used in the "real world".</p></p>
</li><br><br><li class="quesans mb-20">
<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques222"><strong>Question 223. Who Wrote Struts? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>There are several active committers to the Struts project, working cooperatively from around the globe. Dozens of individual developers and committers contributed to the Struts 1.x codebase. All interested Java developers are invited to contribute to the project. Struts is a Apache Software Foundation project, with the mission to "provide secure, enterprise-grade server solutions based on the Java Platform that are developed in an open and cooperative fashion". </p>
<p>Struts was created by Craig R. McClanahan and donated to The Apache Software  Foundation in May 2000. Craig was the primary developer of both Struts 1.x and Tomcat 4. Tomcat 4 was the basis for the official reference implementation for a servlet 2.3 and JSP 1.2 container. </p>
<p>Craig's current focus is as architect of the Sun Java Studio Creator (formerly Project Rave). Craig also serves as the Specification Lead for JavaServer Faces  (JSR-127), and is the Web Layer Architect for the Java2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) platform as a whole. </p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques223"><strong>Question 224. Why Is It Called Struts?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>It's a reference to struts in the architectural sense, a reminder of the nearly invisible pieces that hold up buildings, houses, and bridges.</p></p>
</li><br><br><li class="quesans mb-20">
<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques224"><strong>Question 225. Do I Have To Credit Struts On My Own Website? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>You need to credit Struts if you redistribute your own framework based on Struts for other people to use. (See the Apache License for details.) But you do not need to credit Struts just because your web application utilizes the framework. It's the same situation as using the Apache HTTPD server or Tomcat. Not required if its just running your web site.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques225"><strong>Question 226. Where Can I Get A Copy Of Struts? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The best place to download Struts is at struts.apache.org. The nightly builds are very stable, and recommended as the best place to start today.</p></p>
</li><br><br><li class="quesans mb-20">
<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques226"><strong>Question 227. How Do I Install Struts? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>To develop applications with Struts, you can usually just add the Struts JAR file to your Java development environment. You can then start using the Struts classes as part of your own application. A blank Struts application  (in the webapps directory, open struts-blank.war) is provided, which you can just copy to get a quick-start on your own brainchild. </p>
<p>Since the full source code for Struts is available, we also provide complete instructions for compiling your own Struts JAR from scratch. (This is actually easier than it looks!) </p>
<p>Your Struts application can usually be deployed using a standard WAR file. In most cases, you simply deposit the WAR file on your application server, and it is installed automatically. If not, step-by-step installation instructions for various servlet containers are available.</p></p>
</li><br><br><li class="quesans mb-20">
<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques227"><strong>Question 228. When Do I Need "struts.jar" On My Classpath? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>When you are compiling an application that uses the Struts classes, you must have the "struts.jar" on the classpath your compiler sees -- it does not have to be on your CLASSPATH environment variable. </p>
<p>Why is that an important distinction? Because if you are using a servlet container on your development machine to test your application, the  "struts.jar" must not be on your CLASSPATH environment variable when running the container. (This is because each Web application must also have their own copy of the Struts classes, and the container will become confused if it is on the environment path as well.) </p>
<p>There are several general approaches to this issue: </p>
<p>* Use ANT for building your projects -- it can easily assemble classpaths for the compiler. (This is how Struts itself is built, along with Tomcat and most other Java-based projects).<br/>
* Use an IDE where you can configure the "class path" used for compilation independent of the CLASSPATH environment variable.<br/>
* Use a shell script that temporarily adds struts.jar to the classpath just for compilation, for example javac -classpath /path/to/struts.jar:$CLASSPATH $@</p></p>
</li><br><br><li class="quesans mb-20">
<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques228"><strong>Question 229. Does Struts Include Its Own Unit Tests? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Struts currently has two testing environments, to reflect the fact that some things can be tested statically, and some really need to be done in the environment of a running servlet container.</p>
<p>For static unit tests, we use the JUnit framework. The sources for these tests are in the "src/test" hierarchy in the source repository, and are executed via the "test.junit" target in the top-level build.xml file. Such tests are focused on the low-level functionality of individual methods, are particularly suitable for the static methods in the org.apache.struts.util utility classes. In the test hierarchy, there are also some "mock object" classes (in the org.apache.struts.mock package) so that you can package up things that look like servlet API and Struts API objects to pass in as arguments to such tests.</p>
<p>Another valuable tool is Struts TestCase which provides a useful harness for Action classes that can be used with JUnit or Cactus.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques229"><strong>Question 230. If The Framework Doesn't Do What I Want, Can I Request That A Feature Be Added? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>First, it's important to remember that Struts is an all-volunteer project. We don't charge anyone anything to use Struts. Committers and other developers work on Struts because they need to use it with their own applications. If others can use it too, that's "icing on the cake". If you submit a patch for a feature that a Committer finds useful, then that Committer may choose to volunteer his or her time to apply the patch. If you just submit an idea without a patch, it is much less likely to be added (since first someone else has to volunteer their time to write the patch). </p>
<p>We are grateful for any patches, and we welcome new ideas, but the best way to see that something gets added to the framework is to do as much of the work as you can, rather than rely on the "kindness of strangers". Worst case, you can apply the patch to your copy of Struts and still use the feature in  your own application. (Which is what open source is really all about.)</p></p>
</li><br><br><li class="quesans mb-20">
<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques230"><strong>Question 231. Where Can I Get Help With Struts? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The Struts package comes complete with a Users Guide to introduce people to the framework and its underlying technologies. Various components also have their own in-depth Developers Guide, to cover more advanced topics. Comprehensive Javadocs are included along with the full source code. For your convenience, these are bundled together as a self-installing application. The struts-documentation.war is the same bundle that is deployed as the Struts Web site.</p>
<p>The Strut's mailing list is also very active, and welcomes posts from new users.

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>If you are starting from scratch, packages like Turbine and Espresso can be very helpful since they try to provide all of the basic services that your team is likely to need. Such services include things like data persistence and logging. </p>
<p>If you are not starting from scratch, and need to hook up your web application  to an existing infrastructure, then "plain vanilla" Struts can be a better choice. The core Struts framework does not presuppose that you are using a given set of data persistence, presentation, or logging tools. Anything goes =:0) </p>
<p>Compared to other offerings, Struts endeavors to be a minimalist framework. We try leverage existing technologies whenever we can and provide only the missing pieces you need to combine disparate technologies into a coherent application. This is great when you want to select your own tools to use with Struts. But, if you prefer a more integrated infrastructure, then packages like Turbine or Espresso (which uses Struts) are perfectly good ways to go.</p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Development of both products began about the same time. Leading up to the release of 1.0, it was thought better to continue to develop the taglibs alongside the controller.

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques235"><strong>Question 236. What About Jstl And Javaserver Faces ? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>JSTL, the JavaServer Standard Tag Library, is a set of JSP tags that are designed to make it easier to develop Web applications. JavaServer Faces (JSF) is a specification for a new technology that promises to make it easier to write MVC applications, both for the Web and for the desktop. </p>
<p>The inventor of Struts, Craig McClanahan, is the specification co-lead for JavaServer Faces (JSR 127), and architect of the reference implemenation as well as Java Studio Creator. Both JSTL and JSF are complementary to Struts. </p>
<p>The mainstay of the Struts framework is the controller components, which can be used with any Java presentation technology. As new technologies become available, it is certain that new "glue" components will also appear to help these technologies work as well with Struts.</p>
<p>Struts originally came bundled with a set of custom JSP tags. Today, several extensions are available to help you use Struts with other popular presentation  technologies, like XSLT and Velocity. Likewise, extensions for JSTL and JSF are now available as well. </p>
<p>The JSTL reference implementation is available through the Jakarta Taglibs site. A JSTL taglibs for Struts, Struts-El , is available and distributed with Struts beginning with the 1.1 release. </p>
<p>The JSF specification and reference implementation is available through Sun's The JSF specification and reference implementation is available through Sun's Java ServerFaces page. An early-release JavaServer Faces taglib for Struts, Struts-Faces, is also in early release and available through the nightly build.

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques237"><strong>Question 238. Why Was Reload Removed From Struts (since 1.1)? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The problem with ReloadAction was that Struts was trying to act like a container, but it couldn't do a proper job of it. For example, you can't reload classes that have been modified, or (portably) add new classes to a running web application (even if the container supported it). </p>
<p>Meanwhile, as Struts 1.1 was being developed, work progressed on things like Tomcat's reload command via the Manager webapp. This feature allows you to quickly reload-on-demand, complete with saving and restoring your session). It started to make even less sense for Struts to half-implement a feature that containers are implementing fully.</p>
<p>A more minor point is that freezing the configuration information at application startup time allows Struts to safely access the mapping information without bothering with synchronization. The "startup-only" strategy creates a modest but real improvement in performance for all users. </p>
<p>So, ReloadAction is not supported since Struts 1.1 for two reasons:</p>
<p>* It never did let you reload everything that you would really want to --  particularly changed classes -- so many people ended up having to reload the webapp anyway.<br/>
* Containers are starting to offer reload-on-demand features which does the same thing as the Struts ReloadAction, only better.<br/>
* Not supporting ReloadAction lets Struts avoid doing synchronization locks around all the lookups (like figuring out which action to use, or the destination of an ActionForward) so applications can run a little faster.</p>
<p>Of course, if someone came up with an implementation that solved these problems without creating any others, we would not be opposed to including a new ReloadAction.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques238"><strong>Question 239. What Is A Modular Application? What Does Module-relative Mean? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Since Struts 1.1, the framework supports multiple application modules. All applications have at least one root, or default, module. Like the root directory in a file system, the default application has no name. (Or is named with an empty string, depending your viewpoint.) Developing an application with only a default module is no different from how applications were developed under Struts 1.0. Since Struts 1.1, you can add additional  modules to your application, each of which can have their own configuration files, messages resources, and so forth. Each module is developed in the same way as the default module. Applications that were developed as a single module can added to a multiple module application, and modules can promoted to a standalone application without change. For more about configuring your application to support multiple modules, see Configuring Applications in the User Guide.</p>
<p>But to answer the question =:0), a modular application is a Struts application that uses more than one module. Module-relative means that the URI starts at the module level, rather than at the context level, or the absolute-URL level. </p>
<p>* Absolute URL: http://localhost/myApplication/myModule/myAction.do<br/>
* context-relative: /myModule/myAction.do<br/>
* module-relative: /myAction.do<br/>
The Struts Examples application is a modular application that was assembled from several applications that were created independently.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The framework grew in the telling and, as it evolved, some of the names drifted. The good thing about a nightly build, is that everything becomes available to the community as soon as it is written. The bad thing about a nightly build is that things like class names get locked down early and then become difficult to change.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques240"><strong>Question 241. Why Is Actionform A Base Class Rather Than An Interface? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The MVC design pattern is very simple to understand but much more difficult to live with. You just need this little bit of Business Logic in the View logic or you need just that little bit of View logic in the Business tier and pretty soon you have a real mess.</p>
<p>Making ActionForm a class takes advantage of the single inheritance restriction of Java to it makes it more difficult for people to do things that they should not do.</p>
<p>ActionForms implemented as interfaces encourage making the property types match the underlying business tier instead of Strings, which violates one of the primary purposes for ActionForms in the first place (the ability to reproduce invalid input, which is a fundamental user expectation). ActionForms as an interface would also encourage using existing DAO objects as ActionForms by adding implements ActionForm to the class. This violates the MVC design pattern goal of separation of the view and business logic. </p>
<p>Since the goal of struts is to enforce this separation, it just makes more sense for Struts to own the ActionForm. </p>
<p>DynaActionForms relieve developers of maintaining simple ActionForms. For near zero maintenance, try Niall Pemberton's LazyActionForm.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques241"><strong>Question 242. Do Actionforms Have To Be True Javabeans? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The utilities that Struts uses (Commons-BeanUtils since 1.1) require that ActionForm properties follow the JavaBean patterns for mutators and accessors (get*,set*,is*). Since Struts uses the Introspection API with the ActionForms, some containers may require that all the JavaBean patterns be followed, including declaring "implements Serializable" for each subclass. The safest thing is to review the JavaBean specification and follow all the prescribed patterns.</p>
<p>Since Struts 1.1, you can also use DynaActionForms and mapped-backed forms, which are not true JavaBeans. For more see ActionForm classes in the User Guide and Using Hashmaps with ActionForms in this FAQ.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A problem with a checkbox is that the browser will only include it in the request when it is checked. If it is not checked, the HTML specification suggests that it not be sent (i.e. omitted from the request). If the value of the checkbox is being persisted, either in a session bean or in the model, a checked box can never unchecked by a HTML form -- because the form can never send a signal to uncheck the box. The application must somehow ascertain that since the element was not sent that the corresponding value is unchecked. </p>
<p>The recommended approach for Struts applications is to use the reset method in  the ActionForm to set all properties represented by checkboxes to null or false. The checked boxes submitted by the form will then set those properties to true. The omitted properties will remain false. Another solution is to use radio buttons instead, which always submit a value. </p>
<p>It is important to note that the HTML specification recommends this same behavior whenever a control is not "successful". Any blank element in a HTML form is not guaranteed to submitted. It is therefor very important to set the default values for an ActionForm correctly, and to implement the reset method when the ActionForm might kept in session scope.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques245"><strong>Question 246. Can't I Just Create Some Of My Javabeans In The Jsp Using A Scriptlet? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Struts is designed to encourage a Model 2/MVC architecture. But there is nothing that prevents you from using Model 1 techniques in your JavaServer Pages, so the answer to the question is "Yes, you can". </p>
<p>Though, using Model 1 techniques in a Struts application does go against the grain. The approach recommended by most Struts developers is to create and populate whatever objects the view may need in the Action, and then forward these through the request. Some objects may also be created and stored in the session or context, depending on how they are used. </p>
<p>Likewise, there is nothing to prevent you from using scriptlets along with JSP tags in your pages. Though, many Struts developers report writing very complex  scriplet-free applications and recommend the JSP tag approach to others. </p>
<p>For help with Model 1 techniques and scriptlets, you might consider joining the Javasoft JSP-interest mailing list, where there are more people still using these approaches.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques246"><strong>Question 247. Can I Use Javascript To Submit A Form?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>You can submit a form with a link as below. BTW, the examples below assume you are in an block and 'myForm' is picked up from the struts-config.xml name field of the action. </p>
<p>&lt;a href='javascript:void(document.forms["myForm"].submit()&gt;My  Link&lt;/a&gt; <br/>
Now the trick in the action is to decode what action you intend to perform. Since you are using JavaScript, you could set a field value and look for it in the request or in the form. <br/>
... html/javascript part ... <br/>
&lt;input type='hidden' value='myAction' /&gt;<br/>
&lt;input type='button' value='Save Meeeee'<br/>
onclick='document.forms["myForm"].myAction.value="save";<br/>
document.forms["myForm"].submit();' /&gt;<br/>
&lt;input type='button' value='Delete Meeeee'<br/>
onclick='document.forms["myForm"].myAction.value="delete";<br/>
document.forms["myForm"].submit();' /&gt;<br/>
... the java part ...<br/>
class MyAction extends ActionForm implements Serializable {<br/>
<br/>
public ActionForward execute (ActionMapping map, ActionForm form,<br/>
HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse) {<br/>
<br/>
String myAction = req.getParameter("myAction");<br/>
<br/>
if (myAction.equals("save") {<br/>
// ... save action ...<br/>
} else if (myAction.equals("delete") {<br/>
// ... delete action ...<br/>
}<br/>
}<br/>
}<br/>
}</p>
<p>This is just one of many ways to achieve submitting a form and decoding the intended action. Once you get used to the framework you will find other ways that make more sense for your coding style and requirements. Just remember this  example is completely non-functional without JavaScript.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques248"><strong>Question 249. Why Do The Struts Tags Provide For So Little Formatting?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The Struts tags seem to provide only the most rudimentary functionality. Why is there not better support for date formatting and advanced string handling? </p>
<p>Three reasons: </p>
<p>First, work started on the JSTL and we didn't want to duplicate the effort. <br/>
Second, work started on Java Server Faces, and we didn't want to duplicate that effort either. </p>
<p>Third, in a Model 2 application, most of the formatting can be handled in the ActionForms (or in the business tier), so all the tag has to do is spit out a string. This leads to better reuse since the same "how to format" code does not need to be repeated in every instance. You can "say it once" in a JavaBean and be done with it. Why don't the Struts taglibs offer more layout options? </p>
<p>Since the Struts tags are open source, you can extend them to provide whatever additional formatting you may need. If you are interested in a pre-written taglib that offers more layout options, see the struts-layout taglib. </p>
<p>In the same arena, there is a well regarded contributor taglib that can help you create Menus for your Struts applications.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The &lt;html:link&gt; tag is not intended for use with client-side references like those used to launch Javascripts or email clients. The purpose of link tag is to interject the context (or module) path into the URI so that your server-side links are not dependent on your context (or module) name. It  also encodes the link, as needed, to maintain the client's session on the server. Neither feature applies to client-side links, so there is no reason to use the &lt;html:link&gt; tag. Simply markup the client-side links using the standard tag.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Attribute minimization (that is, specifying an attribute with no value) is a place where HTML violates standard XML syntax rules. This matters a lot for people writing to browsers that support XHTML, where doing so makes the page invalid. It's much better for Struts to use the expanded syntax, which works the same on existing browsers interpreting HTML, and newer browsers that expect XHTML-compliant syntax. Struts is following the behavior recommended by the XHTML specification.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques252"><strong>Question 253. Can I Have An Action Without A Form? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Yes. If your Action does not need any data and it does not need to make any data available to the view or controller component that it forwards to, it doesn't need a form. A good example of an Action with no ActionForm is the LogoffAction in the struts example application:</p>
<p>&lt;action path="/logoff"<br/>
type="org.apache.struts.webapp.example.LogoffAction"&gt;<br/>
&lt;forward name="success" path="/index.jsp"/&gt;<br/>
&lt;/action&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This action needs no data other than the user's session, which it can get from the Request, and it  doesn't need to prepare any view elements for display, so it does not need a form.</p>
<p>However, you cannot use the &lt;html:form&gt; tag without an ActionForm. Even if you want to use the &lt;html:form&gt; tag  with a simple Action that does not require input, the tag will expect you to use some type of ActionForm, even if it is an empty subclass without any properties.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques253"><strong>Question 254. Can You Give Me A Simple Example Of Using The Requiredif Validator Rule?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>First off, there's an even newer Validator rule called validwhen, which is almost certainly what you want to use, since it is much easier and more powerful. It will be available in the first release after 1.1 ships. <br/>
The example shown below could be coded with validwhen as:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;form name="medicalStatusForm"&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;field<br/>
property="pregnancyTest" depends="validwhen"&gt;<br/>

&lt;var-name&gt;test&lt;/var-name&gt;<br/>
&lt;var-value&gt;((((sex == 'm') OR (sex == 'M')) <br/>
AND (*this* == null)) OR (*this* != null))&lt;/test&gt;<br/>
&lt;/var&gt;<br/>
&lt;/field&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Let's assume you have a medical information form<br/>
with three fields,<br/>
sex, pregnancyTest, and testResult. If sex is 'f' or 'F', <br/>
pregnancyTest is required. If pregnancyTest is not blank, <br/>
testResult is required. The entry in your validation.xml <br/>

&lt;field<br/>
property="pregnancyTest" depends="requiredif"&gt;<br/>
&lt;arg0 key="medicalStatusForm.pregnancyTest.label"/&gt;<br/>

&lt;var-name&gt;field[0]&lt;/var-name&gt;<br/>
&lt;var-value&gt;sex&lt;/var-value&gt;<br/>
&lt;/var&gt;<br/>
&lt;var&gt;<br/>
&lt;var-name&gt;fieldTest[0]&lt;/var-name&gt;<br/>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques254"><strong>Question 255. When Is The Best Time To Validate Input? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>This is an excellent question. Let's step back a second and think about a typical mid to large size application. If we start from the back end and work toward the view we have:<br/>
1) Database: Most modern databases are going to validate for required fields, duplicate records, security constraints, etc. <br/>
2) Business Logic: Here you are going to check for valid data relationships and things that make sense for the particular problem you are triing to solve. <br/>
... This is where struts comes into the picture, by now the system should be pretty well bulletproof. What we are going to do is make validation friendlier and informative. Rember it is OK to have duplicate validations... <br/>
3) ActionErrors validate(ActionMapping map, HttpServletRequest req) is where you can do your validation and feed back to the view, information required to correct any errors. validate is run after the form has been reset and after the ActionForm properties have been set from corresponding view based input. Also remember you can turn validation off with validate="false" in the action mapping in the struts-config.xml. This is done by returning an ActionErrors collection with messages from your ApplicationResources.properties file. <br/>
Here you have access to the request so you can see what kinds of action is being requested to fine tune your validations. The &lt;html:error&gt; tag allows you to dump all errors on your page or a particular error associated with a particular property. The input attribute of the struts-config.xml action allows you to send validation errors to a particular jsp / html / tile page. <br/>
4) You can have the system perform low level validations and client side feedback using a ValidatorForm or its derivatives. This will generate javascript and give instant feedback to the user for simple data entry errors. You code your validations in the validator-rules.xml file. A working knowledge of regular expressions is necessary to use this feature effectively.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques255"><strong>Question 256. How Can I Avoid Validating A Form Before Data Is Entered?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The simplest way is to have two actions. The first one has the job of setting the form data, i.e. a blank registration screen. The second action in our writes the registration data to the database. Struts would take care of invoking the validation and returning the user to the correct screen if validation was not complete. </p>
<p>The EditRegistration action in the struts example application illustrates this: </p>
<p>&lt; action path="/editRegistration"&gt;<br/>
type="org.apache.struts.webapp.example.EditRegistrationAction"<br/>
attribute="registrationForm"<br/>
scope="request"<br/>
validate="false"&gt;<br/>
&lt;forward name="success path="/registration.jsp"/&gt;<br/>
&lt;/action&gt;</p>
<p>When the /editRegistration action is invoked, a registrationForm is created and added to the request, but its validate method is not called. The default value of the validate attribute is true, so if you do not want an action to trigger form validation, you need to remember to add this attribute and set it to false.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques256"><strong>Question 257. Declarative Exception Handling </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>If you have developed web applications long enough, you will realize a recurring pattern emerges: when the backend (e.g. the EJB tier) throws you an exception, you nearly always need to display an error page corresponding to the type of that exception. Sooner or later, you will come up with a mechanism to use a lookup table (e.g. an HashMap) to lookup an error page from the exception class. </p>
<p>Struts 1.1 now provides a similar but more powerful mechanism to declare exception handling. In Struts 1.1, you can declare in the struts-config.xml the associations between an exception class and an exception handler. Using the default exception handler included in Struts, you can also specify the path of the error pages. With this information, Struts will automatically forward to the specified pages when an uncaught exception is thrown from an Action. </p>
<p>Like other facilities in Struts, the exception handlers are pluggable. You can write and define your own handler classes if needed. </p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>There are mainly two types of environments in which the configuration of hibernate application differs.<br/>
i. Managed environment – In this kind of environment everything from database connections, transaction boundaries, security levels and all are defined. An example of this kind of environment is environment provided by application servers such as JBoss,  Weblogic and WebSphere.<br/>
ii. Non-managed environment – This kind of environment provides a basic configuration template. Tomcat is one of the best examples that provide this kind of  environment.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The configuration files hibernate.cfg.xml (or hibernate.properties) and mapping files *.hbm.xml are used by the Configuration class to create (i.e. configure and bootstrap hibernate) the SessionFactory, which in turn creates the Session instances. Session instances are the primary interface for the persistence service.</p>
<p>" hibernate.cfg.xml (alternatively can use hibernate.properties): These two files are used to configure the hibernate sevice (connection driver class, connection URL, connection username, connection password, dialect etc). If both files are present in the classpath then hibernate.cfg.xml file overrides the settings found in the hibernate.properties file.</p>
<p>" Mapping files (*.hbm.xml): These files are used to map persistent objects to a relational database. It is the best practice to store each object in an individual mapping file (i.e mapping file per class) because storing large number of persistent classes into one mapping file can be difficult to manage and maintain. The naming convention is to use the same name as the persistent (POJO) class name. For example Account.class will have a mapping file named Account.hbm.xml. Alternatively hibernate annotations can be used as part of your persistent class code instead of the *.hbm.xml files.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Session is a light weight and a non-threadsafe object (No, you cannot share it between threads) that represents a single unit-of-work with the database. Sessions are  opened by a SessionFactory and then are closed when all work is complete. Session is the primary interface for the persistence service. A session obtains a database connection lazily (i.e. only when required). To avoid creating too many sessions ThreadLocal class can be used as shown below to get the current session no matter how many times you make call to the currentSession() method. <br/>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Pros: <br/>
" When long transactions are required due to user think-time, it is the best practice to break the long transaction up into two or more transactions. You can use detached objects from the first transaction to carry data all the way up to the presentation layer. These detached objects get modified outside a transaction and later on re-attached to a new transaction via another session. <br/>
Cons <br/>
" In general, working with detached objects is quite cumbersome, and better to not clutter up the session with them if possible. It is better to discard them and re-fetch them on subsequent requests. This approach is not only more portable but also more efficient because - the objects hang around in Hibernate's cache anyway. <br/>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Both of these methods and saveOrUpdate() method are intended for reattaching a detached object. The session.lock() method simply reattaches the object to the session without checking or updating the database on the assumption that the database in sync with the detached object. It is the best practice to use either session.update(..) or session.saveOrUpdate(). Use session.lock() only if you are absolutely sure that the detached object is in sync with your detached object or if it does not matter because you will be overwriting all the columns that would have changed later on within the same transaction.  Note: When you reattach detached objects you need to make sure that the dependent objects are reatched as well.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>1.You must have a default no-argument constructor for your persistent classes and there should be getXXX() (i.e accessor/getter) and setXXX( i.e. mutator/setter) methods for all your persistable instance variables.<br/>
2.You should implement the equals() and hashCode() methods based on your business key and it is important not to use the id field in your equals() and hashCode() definition if the id field is a surrogate key (i.e. Hibernate managed identifier). This is because the Hibernate only generates and sets the field when saving the object.<br/>
3. It is recommended to implement the Serializable interface. This is potentially useful if you want to migrate around a multi-processor cluster. <br/>
4.The persistent class should not be final because if it is final then lazy loading cannot be used by creating proxy objects. <br/>
5.Use XDoclet tags for generating your *.hbm.xml files or Annotations (JDK 1.5 onwards), which are less verbose than *.hbm.xml files.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The simplest method is to use the static variables of a shared class since there's only one instance of the class and hence only one copy of its static variables. A slightly more reliable method relies on the fact that all the applets on a given page share the same AppletContext. We obtain this applet context as follows:</p>
<p>AppletContext ac = getAppletContext();</p>
<p>AppletContext provides applets with methods such as getApplet(name), getApplets(),getAudioClip, getImage, showDocument and showStatus().</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques337"><strong>Question 338. What Is A Message Driven Bean, What Functions Does A Message Driven Bean Have And How Do They Work In Collaboration With Jms?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Message driven beans are the latest addition to the family of component bean types defined by the EJB specification. The original bean types include session beans, which contain business logic and maintain a state associated with client sessions, and entity beans, which map objects to persistent data. Message driven beans will provide asynchrony to EJB based applications by acting as JMS message consumers. A message bean is associated with a JMS topic or queue and receives JMS messages sent by EJB clients or other beans. Unlike entity beans and session beans, message beans do not have home or remote interfaces. Instead, message driven beans are instantiated by the container as required. Like stateless session beans, message beans maintain no client-specific state, allowing the container to optimally manage a pool of message-bean instances. Clients send JMS messages to message beans in exactly the same manner as they would send messages to any other JMS destination. This similarity is a fundamental design goal of the JMS capabilities of the new specification. To receive JMS messages, message driven beans implement the javax.jms.MessageListener interface, which defines a single onMessage() method. When a message arrives, the container ensures that a message bean corresponding to the message topic/queue exists (instantiating it if necessary), and calls its onMessage method passing the client’s message as the single argument. The message bean’s implementation of this method contains the business logic required to process the message. Note that session beans and entity beans are not allowed to function as message beans.</p></p>
</li><br><br><li class="quesans mb-20">
<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques338"><strong>Question 339. How Does Concurrency Work For Message-driven Beans?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The way concurrency is achieved for Queues is by spawning one JMSSession per MDB instance in the pool. Since JMSSessions are processed in parallel by JMS, concurrency is obtained naturally this way and JMS takes care of delivering the message to, at most, one listener. If an MDB is deployed to multiple servers in a cluster, JMSSessions are created for each MDB instance on each server and load balancing will be done across them.  For Topics in WebLogic JMS 6.1, there is one JMSSession per bean instance in the pool. Because of the way Topics work, the session, and thus every bean instance, receives a copy of each message published on that Topic. (There was also a problem that caused parallel processing not to work correctly. This has been fixed for WLS 6.0 Service Pack 1.) Within a single server, one topic consumer is used to pass out messages to multiple threads to get the concurrency while producing only a single copy of each message. You can configure multiple MDBs to listen on the same topic and each MDB will receive a copy of every message. When using multiple servers, each server gets its own consumer and therefore its own copy of each message. It is not currently possible to share a consumer across multiple servers. If you want a message to be processed by exactly one MDB, use a queue.  One customer had an example where topic MDBs are needed in which there will be multiple implementations of the MDBs listening on the same topic. In other words, more than one MDB with a different implementation may be subscribing to the same topic. The client has no advanced way of knowing how many different kinds of MDBs may be listening on the same topic, but it is possible for there to be more than one listener, therefore topics, not queues. For each kind of MDB listening on the topic, the message is delivered exactly once (i.e., the message will be delivered exactly once to an instance in each named MDB pool listening on the topic).</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques339"><strong>Question 340. What Is The Difference Between Message Driven Beans And Stateless Session Beans?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>In several ways, the dynamic creation and allocation of message-driven bean instances mimics the behavior of stateless session EJB instances, which exist only for the duration of a particular method call. However, message-driven beans are different from stateless session EJBs (and other types of EJBs) in several significant ways: Message-driven beans process multiple JMS messages asynchronously, rather than processing a serialized sequence of method calls. Message-driven beans have no home or remote interface, and therefore cannot be directly accessed by internal or external clients. Clients interact with message-driven beans only indirectly, by sending a message to a JMS Queue or Topic.</p>
<p>Only the container directly interacts with a message-driven bean by creating bean instances and passing JMS messages to those instances as necessary. The Container maintains the entire lifecycle of a message-driven bean; instances cannot be created or removed as a result of client requests or other API calls.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques354"><strong>Question 355. What Is The Infobus?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The InfoBus is a compact Java API which allows cooperating applets or Beans, on a Web page or in any other Java application, to communicate data to one another. The InfoBus architecture enables Beans to be categorized as "data providers" and "data consumers". Data providers are Beans whose primary function is to access data from their native store, such as a DBMS, spreadsheet, flat file, Lotus Notes database etc., and to offer data onto the InfoBus.</p>
<p>Data consumers retrieve data from the bus, for analysis or visual display. This segregation of provider from consumer is extremely powerful in that it enables applications to be independent of their data; for example, a charting Bean need not understand SQL or JDBC in order to access DBMS data.</p>
<p>Of course, a Bean can be both a consumer and provider: for example a spreadsheet may accept data from a DBMS and provide data to a chart Bean.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques355"><strong>Question 356. What Are/is Enterprise Javabeans?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) is an API specification for building scalable, distributed, component-based, multi-tier applications. It leverages and extends the JavaBeans component model to provide a rich object-oriented transactional environment for developers building enterprise applications.</p>
<p>Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) technology is the basis of Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE). EJB technology provides the scalable architecture for executing business logic in a distributed computing environment. J2EE makes the life of an enterprise developer easier by combining the EJB component architecture with other enterprise technologies to solutions on the Java platform for seamless development and deployment of server side applications.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The InfoBus architecture addresses Beans talking to one in a single JVM not across multiple JVMs; while RMI (Remote Method Invocation) is intended for communication across JVMs (different Java Virtual Machines across the network). As for IIOP, one can envision a JavaBeans component that uses RMI to talk to something on another JVM and then publishes the data on the InfoBus.</p>
<p>Additionally, RMI could be used to allow components in different security classes to communicate within the same JVM.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques359"><strong>Question 360. Difference Between Java Beans And Enterprise Java Beans?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><ul>
<li>JavaBeans may be visible or nonvisible at runtime.For example, the visual GUI component may be a button,list box,graphic or a chart. An EJB is a nonvisual ,remote object.</li>
<li>JavaBeans are intended to be local to a single process and are primarly intended to run on the client side.Although one can develop server-side JavaBeans,it is far easier to develop them using the EJB specification instead. EJB's are remotely executable components or business objects that can be deployed only on the server.</li>
<li>JavaBeans is a component technology to create generic Java components that can be composed together into applets and applications.</li>
<li>Even though EJB is a component technology,it neither builds upon nor extends the original JavaBean specification.</li>
<li>JavaBeans have an external interface called the properties interface, which allows a builder tool to interpret the functionality of the bean. EJBs have a dployement descriptor that describes its functionality to an external builder tool or IDE</li>
<li>JavaBeans may have BeanInfo classes,property editors or customizers.</li>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques360"><strong>Question 361. Is The Infobus Client Side Only?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Yes. InfoBus is typically used to communicate among Beans at the client, and it can also be useful for sharing information among components at a single server site. The initial version of InfoBus is not distributed, and is therefore not intended for transmission of data between clients and servers.</p>
<p>A variety of Java communication services, including JDBC, CORBA, and RMI can be used by InfoBus components for access to distributed data. For example, the ESuite Data Access component is a Bean that connects any JDBC compliant data source to the InfoBus. Once the data is on the bus, it can easily be imported by any InfoBus Data Consumer, such as a spreadsheet, chartingcomponent, word processor or data analysis tool.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques368"><strong>Question 369. What Are Introspection Api In Java Beans?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The JavaBeans API architecture supplies a set of classes and interfaces to provide introspection. The BeanInfo (in the API reference documentation) interface of the java.beans package defines a set of methods that allow bean implementors to provide explicit information about their beans. By specifying BeanInfo for a bean component, a developer can hide methods, specify an icon for the toolbox, provide descriptive names for properties, define which properties are bound properties, and much more.</p>
<p>The getBeanInfo(beanName) (in the API reference documentation) of the Introspector (in the API reference documentation) class can be used by builder tools and other automated environments to provide detailed information about a bean. The getBeanInfo method relies on the naming conventions for the bean's properties, events, and methods. A call to getBeanInfo results in the introspection process analyzing the bean?s classes and superclasses.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Customization provides a means for modifying the appearance and behavior of a bean within an application builder so it meets your specific needs. There are several levels of customization available for a bean developer to allow other developers to get maximum benefit from a bean?s potential functionality.</p>
<p>1.By using a property editor. Each bean property has its own property editor. The NetBeans GUI Builder usually displays a bean's property editors in the Properties window. The property editor that is associated with a particular property type edits that property type.<br/>
2. By using customizers. Customizers give you complete GUI control over bean customization. Customizers are used where property editors are not practical or applicable. Unlike a property editor, which is associated with a property, a customizer is associated with a bean.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Container-managed persistence beans are the simplest for the bean developer to create and the most difficult for the EJB server to support. This is because all the logic for synchronizing the bean's state with the database is handled automatically by the container. This means that the bean developer doesn't need to write any data access logic, while the EJB server is supposed to take care of all the persistence needs automatically. With CMP, the container manages the persistence of the entity bean. A CMP bean developer doesn't need to worry about JDBC code and transactions, because the Container performs database calls and transaction management instead of the programmer. Vendor tools are used to map the entity fields to the database and absolutely no database access code is written in the bean class. All table mapping is specified in the deployment descriptor. Otherwise, a BMP bean developer takes the load of linking an application and a database on his shoulders.</p>
<p>The bean-managed persistence (BMP) enterprise bean manages synchronizing its state with the database as directed by the container. The bean uses a database API to read and write its fields to the database, but the container tells it when to do each synchronization operation and manages the transactions for the bean automatically. Bean-managed persistence gives the bean developer the flexibility to perform persistence operations that are too complicated for the container or to use a data source that is not supported by the container.BMP beans are not 100% database-independent, because they may contain database-specific code, but CMP beans are unable to perform complicated DML (data manipulation language) statements. EJB 2.0 specification introduced some new ways of querying database (by using the EJB QL - query language).</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques401"><strong>Question 402. What Is Software Architecture Of Ejb?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Session and Entity EJBs consist of 4 and 5 parts respetively:<br/>
1. A remote interface (a client interacts with it),<br/>
2. A home interface (used for creating objects and for declaring business methods),<br/>
3. A bean object (an object, which actually performs business logic and EJB-specific operations). <br/>
4. A deployment descriptor (an XML file containing all information required for maintaining the EJB) or a set of deployment descriptors (if you are using some container-specific features). <br/>
5.A Primary Key class - is only Entity bean specific.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques403"><strong>Question 404. What Is Bean Managed Transaction?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>If a developer doesn't want a Container to manage transactions, it's possible to implement all database operations manually by writing the appropriate JDBC code. This often leads to productivity increase, but it makes an Entity Bean incompatible with some databases and it enlarges the amount of code to be written. All transaction management is explicitly performed by a developer.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques404"><strong>Question 405. What Are Transaction Attributes? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The transaction attribute specifies how the Container must manage transactions for a method when a client invokes the method via the enterprise bean’s home or component  interface or when the method is invoked as the result of the arrival of a JMS message. (Sun's EJB Specification) Below is a list of transactional attributes:<br/>
<br/>
<strong>1. NotSupported</strong> - transaction context is unspecified.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>2. Required</strong> - bean's method invocation is made within a transactional context. If a client is not associated with a transaction, a new  transaction is invoked automatically. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>3. Supports</strong> - if a transactional context exists, a Container acts like the transaction attribute is Required, else - like NotSupported.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>4. RequiresNew</strong> - a method is invoked in a new transaction context.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>5. Mandatory</strong> - if a transactional context exists, a Container acts like the transaction attribute is Required, else it throws a  javax.ejb.TransactionRequiredException.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>6. Never</strong> - a method executes only if no transaction context is specified.</p></p>

2. Transaction_read_committed- Guarantees that the data you are getting has been committed.<br/>
3. Transaction_repeatable_read - Guarantees that all reads of the database will be the same during the transaction (good for read and update operations).<br/>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>You can pass the HttpSession as parameter to an EJB method, only if all objects in session are serializable.This has to be consider as passed-by-value", that means that its read-only in the EJB. If anything is altered from inside the EJB, it wont be reflected back to the HttpSession of the Servlet Container.The pass-by-reference can be used between EJBs Remote Interfaces, as they are remote references. While it IS possible to pass an HttpSession as a parameter to an EJB object, it is considered to be bad practice in terms of object oriented design. This is because you are creating an unnecessary coupling between back-end objects (ejbs) and front-end objects (HttpSession). Create a higher-level of abstraction for your ejbs api. Rather than passing the whole, fat, HttpSession (which carries with it a bunch of http semantics), create a class that acts as a value object (or structure) that holds all the data you need to pass back and forth between front-end/back-end. Consider the case where your ejb needs to support a non-http-based client. This higher level of abstraction will be flexible enough to support it.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The EJB container maintains an instance pool. The container uses these instances for the EJB Home reference irrespective of the client request. while refering the EJB Object classes the container creates a separate instance for each client request. The instance pool maintainence is up to the implementation of the container. If the container provides one, it is available otherwise it is not mandatory for the provider to implement it. Having said that, yes most of the container providers implement the pooling functionality to increase the performance of the application server. The way it is implemented is again up to the implementer.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques410"><strong>Question 411. Can You Control When Passivation Occurs?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The developer, according to the specification, cannot directly control when passivation occurs. Although for Stateful Session Beans, the container cannot passivate an instance that is inside a transaction. So using transactions can be a a strategy to control passivation.</p>
<p>The ejbPassivate() method is called during passivation, so the developer has control over what to do during this exercise and can implement the require optimized logic.</p>
<p>Some EJB containers, such as BEA WebLogic, provide the ability to tune the container to minimize passivation calls.</p>
<p>Taken from the WebLogic 6.0 DTD -"The passivation-strategy can be either "default" or "transaction". With the default setting the container will attempt to keep a working set of beans in the cache. With the "transaction" setting, the container will passivate the bean after every transaction (or method call for a non-transactional invocation).</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques411"><strong>Question 412. What Is The Advantage Of Using Entity Bean For Database Operations, Over Directly Using Jdbc Api To Do Database Operations? When Would I Use One Over The Other?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Entity Beans actually represents the data in a database. It is not that Entity Beans replaces JDBC API. There are two types of Entity Beans Container Managed and Bean Mananged. In Container Managed Entity Bean - Whenever the instance of the bean is created the container automatically retrieves the data from the DB/Persistance storage and assigns to the object variables in bean for user to manipulate or use them. For this the developer needs to map the fields in the database to the variables in deployment descriptor files (which varies for each vendor).</p>
<p>In the Bean Managed Entity Bean - The developer has to specifically make connection, retrive values, assign them to the objects in the ejbLoad() which will be called by the container when it instatiates a bean object. Similarly in the ejbStore() the container saves the object values back the the persistance storage. ejbLoad and ejbStore are callback methods and can be only invoked by the container. Apart from this, when you use Entity beans you dont need to worry about database transaction handling, database connection pooling etc. which are taken care by the ejb container. But in case of JDBC you have to explicitly do the above features. what suresh told is exactly perfect. ofcourse, this comes under the database transations, but i want to add this. the great thing about the entity beans of container managed, whenever the connection is failed during the transaction processing, the database consistancy is mantained automatically. the container writes the data stored at persistant storage of the entity beans to the database again to provide the database consistancy. where as in jdbc api, we, developers has to do manually.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques412"><strong>Question 413. What Is Ejb Ql?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>EJB QL is a Query Language provided for navigation across a network of enterprise beans and dependent objects defined by means of container managed persistence. EJB QL is introduced in the EJB 2.0 specification. The EJB QL query language defines finder methods for entity beans with container managed persistenceand is portable across containers and persistence managers. EJB QL is used for queries of two types of finder methods: Finder methods that are defined in the home interface of an entity bean and which return entity objects. Select methods, which are not exposed to the client, but which are used by the Bean Provider to select persistent values that are maintained by the Persistence Manager or to select entity objects that are related to the entity bean on which the query is defined.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>EEJB was originally designed around remote invocation using the Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) mechanism, and later extended to support to standard CORBA transport for these calls using RMI/IIOP. This design allowed for maximum flexibility in developing applications without consideration for the deployment scenario, and was a strong feature in support of a goal of component reuse in J2EE.</p>
<p>Many developers are using EJBs locally -- that is, some or all of their EJB calls are between beans in a single container.</p>
<p>With this feedback in mind, the EJB 2.0 expert group has created a local interface mechanism. The local interface may be defined for a bean during development, to allow streamlined calls to the bean if a caller is in the same container.

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques414"><strong>Question 415. What Are The Special Design Care That Must Be Taken When You Work With Local Interfaces?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>EIt is important to understand that the calling semantics of local interfaces are different from those of remote interfaces. For example, remote interfaces pass parameters using call-by-value semantics, while local interfaces use call-by-reference.</p>
<p>This means that in order to use local interfaces safely, application developers need to carefully consider potential deployment scenarios up front, then decide which interfaces can be local and which remote, and finally, develop the application code with these choices in mind.</p>
<p>While EJB 2.0 local interfaces are extremely useful in some situations, the long-term costs of these choices, especially when changing requirements and component reuse are taken into account, need to be factored into the design decision.</p></p>

2. Web Archives (WAR) WAR files are similar to JAR files, except that they are specifically for web applications made from Servlets, JSPs, and supporting classes.<br/>
3. Enterprise Archives (EAR) ”An EAR file contains all of the components that make up a particular J2EE application.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>An EJB can use local client view only if it is really guaranteed that other enterprise beans or clients will only address the bean within a single JVM. With local client view, you can do pass-by-reference, which means your bean, as well as the client, will work directly with one copy of the data. Any changes made by the bean will be seen by the client and vice versa. Pass-by-reference eliminates time/system expenses for copying data variables, which provides a performance advantage.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A select method can return a persistent field (or a collection thereof) of a related entity bean. A finder method can return only a local or remote interface (or a collection of interfaces).</p>
<p>Because it is not exposed in any of the local or remote interfaces, a select method cannot be invoked by a client. It can be invoked only by the methods implemented within the entity bean class. A select method is usually invoked by either a business or a home method.</p>
<p>A select method is defined in the entity bean class. For bean-managed persistence, a finder method is defined in the entity bean class, but for container-managed persistence it is not.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques480"><strong>Question 481. What Is The Use Of Bytesmessage?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>BytesMessage contains an array of primitive bytes in it's payload. Thus it can be used for transfer of data between two applications in their native format which may not be compatible with other Message types. It is also useful where JMS is used purely as a transport between two systems and the message payload is opaque to the JMS client. Whenever you store any primitive type, it is converted into it's byte representation and then stored in the payload. There is no boundary line between the different data types stored. Thus you can even read a long as short. This would result in erroneous data and hence it is advisable that the payload be read in the same order and using the same type in which it was created by the sender.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques481"><strong>Question 482. What Is The Use Of Streammessage?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>StreamMessage carries a stream of Java primitive types as it's payload. It contains some conveient methods for reading the data stored in the payload. However, StreamMessage prevents reading a long value as short, something that is allowed in case of BytesMessage. This is so because the StreamMessage also writes the type information along with the value of the primitive type and enforces a set of strict conversion rules which actually prevents reading of one primitive type as another.</p></p>

</li><br><br><li class="quesans mb-20">
<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques483"><strong>Question 484. What Is The Use Of Objectmessage?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>ObjectMessage contains a Serializable java object as it's payload. Thus it allows exchange of Java objects between applications. This in itself mandates that both the applications be Java applications. The consumer of the message must typecast the object received to it's appropriate type. Thus the consumer should before hand know the actual type of the object sent by the sender. Wrong type casting would result in ClassCastException. Moreover the class definition of the object set in the payload should be available on both the machine, the sender as well as the consumer. If the class definition is not available in the consumer machine, an attempt to type cast would result in ClassNotFoundException. Some of the MOMs might support dynamic loading of the desired class over the network, but the JMS specification does not mandate this behavior and would be a value added service if provided by your vendor. And relying on any such vendor specific functionality would hamper the portability of your application. Most of the time the class need to be put in the classpath of both, the sender and the consumer, manually by the developer.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques485"><strong>Question 486. What Is The Difference Between Bytesmessage And Streammessage??</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>BytesMessage stores the primitive data types by converting them to their byte representation. Thus the message is one contiguous stream of bytes. While the StreamMessage maintains a boundary between the different data types stored because it also stores the type information along with the value of the primitive being stored. BytesMessage allows data to be read using any type. Thus even if your payload contains a long value, you can invoke a method to read a short and it will return you something. It will not give you a semantically correct data but the call will succeed in reading the first two bytes of data. This is strictly prohibited in the StreamMessage. It maintains the type information of the data being stored and enforces strict conversion rules on the data being read.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>If the JMS server experiences a failure, for example, a power outage, any message that it is holding in primary storage potentially could be lost. With persistent storage, the JMS server logs every message to secondary storage. (The logging occurs on the front end, that is, as part of handling the send operation from the message producing client.) The logged message is removed from secondary storage only after it has been successfully delivered to all consuming clients .</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Bytes Message stores data in bytes.  Thus the message is one contiguous stream of bytes. While the Stream Message maintains a boundary between the different data types stored because it also stores the type information along with the value of the primitive being stored. Bytes Message allows data to be read using any type. Thus even if your payload contains a long value, you can invoke a method to read a short and it will return you something. It will not give you a semantically correct data but the call will succeed in reading the first two bytes of data. This is strictly prohibited in the Stream Message. It maintains the type information of the data being stored and enforces strict conversion rules on the data being read.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>JBoss jBPM is a platform for process languages. At the base there is a java library to define and execute graphs. The actual process constructs like e.g. send email, user task and update database are defined on top of this. Every process language is made up of a set of such process constructs. And that is what is pluggable in this base library. On top of the JBoss jBPM base library, there are implemented several process languages as a set of process constructs: jPDL, BPEL and SEAM pageflow:</p>
<p>•	jPDL is a process language with a clean interface to Java and very sophisticated task management capabilities. There is no standard for Java process languages, so it is proprietary.<br/>
•	BPEL is a service orchestration language. As said before, in BPEL, you can write new services as a function of other services. This is typically a component of an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).<br/>
•	SEAM pageflow is a language that allows for the graphically define the navigation between pages in a SEAM web application.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The perception of EJB3 as being a simple clone of Hibernate is primarily based on developer familiarity with Hibernate and a similarity of naming, as well as common purpose, and that Hibernate is morphing itself into an EJB3 implementation based on the work going into the specification, not the other way around.</p>
<p>EJBs are supposed to be components, in the sense that they're not just one class, but a set of classes, descriptors and usage and management contracts. All of this in order to allow a container (JBoss, Weblogic, etc.) to  provide services to those components, and to be able to reuse and distribute this components. This services are, among others, transactions, concurrent access control, security, instance pooling, etcetera.</p>
<p>Hibernat is  "just" an ORM (Object/Relational Mapping) tool. Quick and dirty, this means you can store an object tree belonging to an class hierarchy in a  relational DB without writing a single SQL query. Quite cool, IMO.

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques567"><strong>Question 568. What Do You Understand By The Term Network?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A network is a set of computers and peripherals, such as modems and printers, that are physically connected together. A particular network has a unique set of hardware and software that enables various computers and peripherals to communicate. The power of networks enables computers to share resources. For example, a small computer on a network can access and use other computers that are much more powerful.<br/>
<br/>
One Java design goal was to support the development of complex programs that are small, bug free and easy to understand. One of the areas in which Java's creators have succeeded with this goal is in the Network class. In other programming languages, performing the simplest network task can require pages of codes. With Java, in contrast, many of these tasks have been reduced to a single statement. For example, opening a file across a network in Java is not much more complicated than opening a local file. Because of this ease in programming, Java should make network programming common place.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques568"><strong>Question 569. Explain The Generic Term Internet.</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The generic term internet refers to a network of networks. The Internet is just one particular internet. However, it is the ultimate network of networks. Because you are interested in Java, you have certainly used a Web browser to surf the Internet. As you probably know, a Web browser is only one of many Internet applications.<br/>
Other Internet applications include e-mail, network news, file transfers and telnet. Other than e-mail, some users on the Web aren't aware of these other applications. Each has played an important role in getting the Internet where it is today. For example, network news, also called Usenet, is still a popular way for users to exchange information using a bulletin-board like media. Usenet lets users discuss a wide range of topics.<br/>
In the early days, the Internet was developed by the academic community. Usenet and e-mail were ideal for researchers to communicate with each other across the country. Today, Usenet topics cover all aspects of human internet and e-mail is an indispensable business tool.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques569"><strong>Question 570. What Does Tcp/ip Stand For And What Is Its Use?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>To communicate across the Internet, a program must follow a specific set of rules, called protocols. These protocols may specify the size and format of the program's electronic messages or how programs synchronize messages. In short, who sends the first message and what type of reply the sender expects.<br/>
<br/>
The primary protocol on the Internet is TCP/IP (the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), The TCP/IP protocols define the rules that computers and peripherals on the Internet use to communicate. For example, TCP/IP protocols defines how a program finds a particular device on a network, the format the program must use to send the device data, how the program should check for errors and so on. </p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques570"><strong>Question 571. What Do You Understand By The Term Client-server Application?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Networks make many new types of applications possible because a single machine no longer has to do everything. Within a network, some computers, called servers, perform specialized tasks on behalf of other programs. A program that uses a server is a client.<br/>
A server is simply a computer that runs a specific program continuously whose role purpose is to provide a service to other programs. A client, on the other hand, is a program that receives service from the server. For example, a print server is a software program that waits until other programs (the clients) send their files to print. The server then prints the files on behalf of the client. There are many types of servers across the Internet with which you may be familiar, such as mail servers, file servers and of course, World Wide (or HTTP) servers.</p></p>
</li><br><br><li class="quesans mb-20">
<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques571"><strong>Question 572. What Are Protocols? What Are They Used For?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>To write a client-server application, you must create two programs: the client and the server. Within these programs, you must define how the two applications will communicate—the rules each program must follow. As you have learned, the rules the client and server program must follow to communicate are protocols. In short, protocols define how client-server programs interact.<br/>
Most programmers implement protocols using a series of layers, where each layer deals with a particular task. For example, the lowest layer might deal with the actual communication across the network hardware. The next layer might check the bits sent across the network for communication errors. Likewise, the next layer might package the bits into a message format your program understands. Client-server applications use upper-layer protocols that are normally based on a specific application (such as printing a file or transferring a file). The upper-layer protocol defines a strict set of rules on how two applications exchange data.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques572"><strong>Question 573. What Is The Relationship Between Servers And Ports?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>As you have learned, an IP address identifies a computer on the Internet. You also learned that a port number identifies a process (a program) that is running on a computer. As it turns out, programs use port numbers for client and server applications. Because IP addresses are unique and on a given computer, port numbers are unique, a port number combined with an IP address completely distinguishes an application running on the Internet. The combination of port number and IP address yields a socket and provides an end point of a communication path. As you will learn the same application IP address and port number may use multiple sockets, each having a different value. Thus, a socket's value combines an application-specific value with the IP address and port number.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques573"><strong>Question 574. What Is The Applet Client Restriction?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Java places restrictions on an applet. One restriction is that an applet cannot make a Socket connection to any server other than the one it came from (the server from which the browser downloaded the applet). Therefore, you cannot, for example, make a generic mail tool applet unless you plan to support it with SMTP and POP3 mail servers on the same machine that stores the applet. Also, because of this restriction, you cannot have two applets connect directly together, so that two users can play a game. Consequently, you should always take applet restrictions into consideration when you design a Java-server application with applets.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques574"><strong>Question 575. Why Servers Should Be Multithreading? Explain.</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>As you know, multithreading lets your Java program perform tasks in parallel. A server is a great example of a program that should be multithreaded. If a server has a single thread of control, only one client can interact with the server at any one time. If you write your server to support multithreading, the server can process many client-server connections simultaneously.</p></p>
</li><br><br><li class="quesans mb-20">
<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques575"><strong>Question 576. Why A Client Should Be Multithreading? Explain.</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>In many types of client applications, support for multiple threads is also useful. A Web browser, for example, is a multithreaded application. Within a browser, you can have multiple windows open and perform multiple downloads at the same time. To perform each download operation, the browser simply starts a new thread which preforms the corresponding processing.<br/>
When your program writes information to or receives information from a stream, a program that uses a single thread of control must wait for the I/O operation to complete—a process called I/O blocking. If you use multiple threads to perform the stream read and write operations, your application can continue to perform other operations. When you write client applications, take advantage of Java's multithreading to make your programs interface more user-friendly and more responsive.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Ever since the first computers were connected, people have been using them to talk. A chat area is an interface that lets a group of people talk by typing messages. Like all Internet-based program, chat programs must follow a specific protocol: Specifically, chat programs rely on the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol. However, chatting on a Web page has been ad-hoc at best, until Java.<br/>
With Java, a Web page can have a fully featured chat area. Features such as instant messages and membership rooms are not difficult to implement. Due to the applet restrictions, chat applets on the same page will have to communicate through a server on the computer where they reside.</p></p>
