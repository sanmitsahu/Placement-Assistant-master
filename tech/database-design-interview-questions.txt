<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Database design is the process of producing a detailed data model of database. This data model contains all the needed logical and physical design choices and physical storage parameters needed to generate a design in a data definition language, which can then be used to create a database.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques1"><strong>Question 2. What Is The Logical Design Of A Database?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The process of logical design involves arranging data into a series of logical relationships called entities and attributes. An entity represents a chunk of information. In relational databases, an entity often maps to a table. An attribute is a component of an entity and helps define the uniqueness of the entity.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques2"><strong>Question 3. What Is The Structure Of A Database?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Instead of having all the data in a list with a random order, a database provides a structure to organize the data. One of the most common data structures is a database table. A database table consists of rows and columns. A database table is also called a two-dimensional array.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques3"><strong>Question 4. What Is A Logical Data Model?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A logical data model or logical schema is a data model of a specific problem domain expressed independently of a particular database management product or storage technology (physical data model) but in terms of data structures such as relational tables and columns, object-oriented classes, or XML tags.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques4"><strong>Question 5. What Is A Conceptual Data Model?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A conceptual schema is a high-level description of a business's informational needs. It typically includes only the main concepts and the main relationships among them. ... The conceptual model is also known as the data model as data model can be used to describe the conceptual schema when a database system is implemented.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques5"><strong>Question 6. What Is The Physical Data Model?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A physical database model shows all table structures, including column name, column data type, column constraints, primary key, foreign key, and relationships between tables. Features of a physical data model include: Specification all tables and columns. Foreign keys are used to identify relationships between tables.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques6"><strong>Question 7. What Is The Conceptual Design Of A Database?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>This phase is called conceptual design. The result of this phase is an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram or UML class diagram. It is a high-level data model of the specific application area. It describes how different entities (objects, items) are related to each other.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques7"><strong>Question 8. What Is A Conceptual Model For Research?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A conceptual model is a representation of a system, made of the composition of concepts which are used to help people know, understand, or simulate a subject the model represents. Some models are physical objects; for example, a toy model which may be assembled, and may be made to work like the object it represents.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques9"><strong>Question 10. What Is The Framework Of A Research?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Theories are formulated to explain, predict, and understand phenomena and, in many cases, to challenge and extend existing knowledge within the limits of critical bounding assumptions. The theoretical framework is the structure that can hold or support a theory of a research study.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques10"><strong>Question 11. What Is The Conceptual Framework?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A conceptual framework is an analytical tool with several variations and contexts. It is used to make conceptual distinctions and organize ideas. Strong conceptual frameworks capture something real and do this in a way that is easy to remember and apply.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques12"><strong>Question 13. What Is An Example Of A Physical Model?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Physical model (most commonly referred to simply as a model but in this context distinguished from a conceptual model) is a smaller or larger physical copy of an object. The object being modelled may be small (for example, an atom) or large (for example, the Solar System).</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Data modeling is often the first step in database design and object-oriented programming as the designers first create a conceptual model of how data items relate to each other. Data modeling involves a progression from conceptual model to logical model to physical schema.</p></p>

<li>In a logical data model, primary keys are present, whereas in a conceptual data model, no primary key is present.</li>
<li>In a logical data model, all attributes are specified within an entity. No attributes are specified in a conceptual data model.</li>
<li>Relationships between entities are specified using primary keys and foreign keys in a logical data model. In a conceptual data model, the relationships are simply stated, not specified, so we simply know that two entities are related, but we do not specify what attributes are used for this relationship.</li>
