<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Overcharging a refrigeration or air conditioning system can result in an explosion. To avoid serious injury or death, never overcharge the system. Always use proper charging techniques. Limit charge amounts to those specified on the system equipment serial label or in the original equipment manufacturer's service information.</p>
<p>Overcharging the system immerses the compressor motor, piston, connecting rods, and cylinders in liquid refrigerant. This creates a hydraulic block preventing the compressor from starting. The hydraulic block is also known as locked rotor.</p>
<p>Continued supply of electricity to the system causes heat to build in the compressor. This heat will eventually vaporize the refrigerant and rapidly increase system pressure. If, for any reason, the thermal protector fails to open the electrical circuit, system pressure can raise to high enough levels to cause a compressor-housing explosion.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques5"><strong>Question 6. Will A Steel Cable Become Longer If It Is Heated While Under Load?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Even the heaviest steel cables stretch under load, whether they heat or not. Heating the cable will certainly elongate it. Friction caused by guides or pulleys can greatly increase the temperature of a cable under load.</p>
<p>You might consider the possibility of total failure if the heat is high enough and I am not sure but the cable might act in unpredictable ways when it fails. Applying heat to a steel cable under load is probably dangerous to your health and the health of anyone nearby.</p>
<p>When steel is heated, steel expands. It does not need to be under load. That is the reason that in the old days before advanced electronics and optics surveyors used chains rather than cables for measuring land. Had they used cable they would have gotten different measurements in summer and winter based on the difference in temperature and the coefficient of expansion of the material. The coefficient of expansion is a number that informs just how much a given material will expand or contract for a given change in temperature.</p>
<p>To find the coefficient of expansion and other interesting information consult a materials handbook, available in better libraries or your local college of engineering. Another example of expanding steel and the necessity for dealing with this characteristic is the overlapping slip joint found on bridges that allows horizontal structural members to expand and contract without damaging the bridge.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A supercharger is a used to increase the volume of air dragged into each cylinder per stroke.</p>
<p>In combustion engines, there are only really two ways to increase power, firstly increase the amount of fuel in the engine (either increase the displacement, or add more cylinders) or increase the amount of air in the engine (for a more effective explosion of the fuel)</p>
<p>Superchargers are powered by the engines crankshaft, which is connected usually by a belt drive. This rotational power turns a fan, which sucks air into the intake manifold similar in effect to turbochargers, with reduced lag. However, superchargers take more energy out the engine, so swings and roundabouts.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques13"><strong>Question 14. What Is The Difference Between An Electric Motor And An Electric Generator?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>There is no fundamental difference between an electric motor and an electric generator or dynamo. In normal use, all motors behave as generators, and all generators behave as motors. DC Motors act like generators because they use less electrical energy when allowed to spin fast. DC generators act like motors because they become easier to spin when less electrical energy is drawn from their terminals.</p>
<p>For example, connect two small DC magnet motors together. Then if you spin the shaft of the first motor, the second motor's shaft will start spinning too. One acts as a DC generator, and the other acts as a DC motor. Alternatively, spin the second one's shaft, and the first one will start spinning.</p>
<p>Another example: If you connect a small DC motor to a small battery, then an electric current will appear in the motor's coils, and the motor starts spinning. However, if you spin the motor's shaft slightly faster than the normal speed, the direction of current in the circuit will reverse, and the battery starts taking in energy from the motor. The motor has become a generator, and it is recharging the battery.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques18"><strong>Question 19. How Is A Submarine Able To Submerge And Surface?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Submarines have ballast tanks. The tanks can hold air, or they can be "vented" and water can flow into them and fill them completely. When the tanks are full of air, the submarine is buoyant and floats. When the main vents are opened, the tanks are flooded and the submarine submerges. When the submarine is submerged, wants to surface, air can be injected at high pressure into the ballast tanks to force out water, again make the submarine buoyant, and cause it to rise to the surface and float.</p>
<p>In practice, when a submarine surfaces, it doesn't use a lot of air from its high pressure air tanks to "blow the ballast tanks" because it takes a long time to pump up the high pressure air tanks again. What happens is that all the ballast tanks are given a "good shot" of high-pressure air (a few seconds), and then the planes are used in conjunction with the screw (which some call a propellor) to actually drive a submarine to the surface. Once there, something called a low-pressure blower system can be used to finish blowing the ballast tanks (while the high-pressure air compressors are running to pump the high-pressure air tanks back up).</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The combination of the words turbine and propeller in techno jargon will give you the word "turboprop". A turboprop engine is a turbojet (gas turbine) engine, which powers the propeller/s.</p>
<p>A conventional jet engine produces its thrust in large part due to the heated gasses escaping out the rear of the engine. While this is very useful for aircraft, which fly at high speeds and high altitudes, it is less desirable for aircraft, which are designed to fly at slower speeds and take off from smaller runways.</p>
<p>A turboprop engine is a jet engine, which converts the bulk of its thrust into rotational energy for powering a propeller. This allows jet engines, which are a high-rpm low-torque engine to be used in situations where low-rpm and high-torque are needed instead.</p>
<p>The higher reliability and efficiency of a jet or turboprop engine as compared to an internal combustion engine makes them very desirable for aircraft designs, which, in the past, would have utilized internal combustion engines.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Both the hydraulic and engine oils are made from base oils with additives mixed in. The additives used change the characteristics of the oils so that they function differently.</p>
<p>Generally, hydraulic oils (final product including additives) are expected to have very low compressibility and very predictable friction and viscosity stability under pressure.</p>
<p>Generally engine oils (Engine Lubrication Oils anyway) are intended to have high resistance to heat (degradation including chemical and viscosity due to heat) resistance to burning and resistance to absorption of fuels and chemical compounds produced during combustion.</p>
<p>Both classes of oils are likely to have additives intended to provide detergency and to reduce foaming.</p>
<p>Base oils are most commonly petroleum oil bases due to cost, but other bases oil can be used including mineral oils (especially for hydraulic oils) and plant oils (especially for engine oils) and oils from animal sources.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques33"><strong>Question 34. What Is Wet Corrosion And Galvanic Corrosion?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Galvanic corrosion is an electrochemical process in which one metal corrodes preferentially when in electrical contact with a different type of metal and both metals are immersed in an electrolyte.</p>
<p>When two or more different sorts of metal come into contact in the presence of an electrolyte, a galvanic couple is set up as different metals have different electrode potentials. The electrolyte provides a means for ion migration whereby metallic ions can move from the anode to the cathode. This leads to the anodic metal corroding more quickly than it otherwise would; the corrosion of the cathodic metal is retarded even to the point of stopping. The presence of electrolyte and a conducting path between the metals may cause corrosion where otherwise neither metal alone would have corroded.</p>
<p>Wet Corrosion: The main feature of corrosion of a divalent metal M in an aqueous solution containing oxygen is because of the corrosion process consists of an anodic and a cathodic reaction. In the anodic reaction (oxidation), the metal is dissolved and transferred to the solution as ions M2+. The cathodic reaction in the example is reduction of oxygen. It is seen that the process makes an electrical circuit without any accumulation of charges.</p>
<p>The electrons released by the anodic reaction are conducted through the metal to the cathodic area where they are consumed in the cathodic reaction. A necessary condition for such a corrosion process is that the environment is a conducting liquid (an electrolyte) that is in contact with the metal. The electrical circuit is closed by ion conduction through the electrolyte. In accordance with the conditions, this dissolution process is called wet corrosion, and the mechanism is typically electrochemical.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>There are a few different designs:</p>

<p>Wedge gate valves use a tapered disk that slides into two seats set at a slight, converging angle. The wedging action provides the sealing force between the disk and the seat.</p>
<p>Single disk gate valves are used where the flow is always one-way (like sluices on dams). There is some flexibility in the attachment of the disk to the stem, so the differential pressure on the disk pushes it against the seat, sealing it off.</p></p>
