<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Bode plots are a graphical way to display the behavior of a circuit over a wide range of frequencies. By plotting the amplitude and phase versus the logarithm of frequency, each unit of change on the ω axis is equal to a factor of 10 also called a decade of frequency. Also, there may be a wide distribution in the amplitude response over a specified range of frequencies. The usual way is to plot the amplitude in dB and phase in degrees or radians versus the logarithm of frequency.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>In an electric circuit, it is often convenient to have a voltage source rather than a current source (e.g. in mesh analysis) or vice versa. This is made possible using source transformations. It should be noted that only practical voltage and current sources can be transformed.</p>
<p>In other words, a Th´evenin’s equivalent circuit is transformed into a Norton’s one or vice versa. The parameters used in the transformation are given as follows.</p>
<p>Th´evenin parameters: VTH ,RTH =⇒ RN = RTH ,IN = VTH/RTH.</p>
<p>Norton parameters: IN ,RN =⇒ RTH = RN ,VTH = RN IN.</p>
<p>Any load resistance, RL will have the same voltage across, and current through it when connected across the terminals of either source.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p><strong>Working and Construction of a capacitor :</strong></p>
<p>Whenever voltage is applied across its terminals, (Also known as charging of a capacitor) current start to flow and continue to travel until the voltage across both the negative and positive (Anode and Cathode) plates become equal to the voltage of the source (Applied Voltage). These two plates are separated by a dielectric material (such as mice, paper, glass, etc. which are insulators), which is used to increase the capacitance of the capacitor.</p>
<p>When we connect a charged capacitor across a small load, it starts to supply the voltage (Stored energy) to that load until the capacitor fully discharges.</p>
<p>Capacitor comes in different shapes and their value is measured in farad (F). Capacitors are used in both AC and DC systems </p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques28"><strong>Question 29. Why We Can’t Store Ac In Batteries Instead Of Dc.or Can We Store Ac In Batteries Instead Of Dc?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>We cannot store AC in batteries because AC changes their polarity up to 50 (When frequency = 50 Hz) or 60 (When frequency = 60 Hz) times in a second. Therefore the battery terminals keep changing Positive (+ve) becomes Negative (-Ve) and vice versa, but the battery cannot change their terminals with the same speed so that’s why we can’t store AC in Batteries.</p>
<p> in addition, when we connect a battery with AC Supply, then It will charge during positive half cycle and discharge during negative half cycle, because the Positive (+ve) half cycle cancel the negative (-Ve) half cycle, so the average voltage or current in a complete cycle is Zero. So there is no chance to store AC in the Batteries.</p></p>
