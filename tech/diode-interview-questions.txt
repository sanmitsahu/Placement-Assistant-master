<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques7"><strong>Question 8. Explain What Is Reverse Saturation Current?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Reverse current of a diode is due to minority carriers and is caused when the diode is reverse biased. Only a very small voltage is required to direct all minority carriers across the junction, and when all minority carriers are flowing across, further increase in bias voltage will not cause increase in current. This current is referred to as reverse saturation current.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques8"><strong>Question 9. Why Is Germanium More Temperature Dependent Than Silicon?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Because the reserve saturation current in case of a germanium diode is approximately 1,000 times larger.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques9"><strong>Question 10. What Is The Effect Of Temperature On The Reverse Saturation Current Of A Diode?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Reverse saturation current, theoretically , increases by 8% per oC for silicon and 11% per oC for germanium. But from experimental data it is found that that reverse saturation current increases by 7% per oC for both silicon and germanium. This is because a surface leakage current component of reverse saturation current is independent of temperature. Since (1.07)10 =2.0 (approx.), the reverse saturation current approximately doubles for every 10oC rise in temperature.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques10"><strong>Question 11. What Is Static Resistance Of A Diode?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The static or dc resistance of a diode is the resistance offered by it to the direct current . It is defined as the ratio of the diode voltage and current at the point of interest and is not sensitive to the shape of the V-I characteristic curve. It decreases with the increase in diode current or voltage.</p></p>
