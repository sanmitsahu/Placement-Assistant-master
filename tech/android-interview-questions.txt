<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>No, Android is not yet available in a ROM format. Currently Android is installed by using a clean SD Card, and booted from there. It is booted by running a special application called 'Haret.exe' residing on your SD Card which will terminate the Windows kernel and boot into Linux/Android. It can't easily be run from ROM because a) it's too experimental to risk putting in ROM and then killing a device and b) WinMo does some hardware initialisation that isn't documented, but is needed before Android can run.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Android includes a set of core libraries that provides most of the functionality available in the corelibraries of the Java programming language. Every Android application runs in its own process, with its own instance of the Dalvik virtual machine. Dalvik has been written so that a device can run multiple VMs efficiently. The Dalvik VM executes files in the Dalvik Executable (.dex) format which is optimized for minimal memory footprint.

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques8"><strong>Question 9. Creating An Android Application Using The Eclipse Plugin?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Using the Android Eclipse plugin is the fastest and easiest way to start creating a new Androidapplication. The plugin automatically generates the correct project structure for your application, and keeps the resources compiled for you automatically.</p>
<p>It is still a good idea to know what is going on though. Take a look at Overview of an AndroidApplication to understand the basics of how an Android application works.</p>
<p>It is also recommended that you take a look at the ApiDemos application and the other sample applications in the samples/ folder in the SDK.</p>
<p>Finally, a great way to started with Android development in Eclipse is to follow both the Hello Android and Notepad code tutorials. In particular, the start of the Hello Android tutorial is an excellent introduction to creating a new Android application in Eclipse.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques10"><strong>Question 11. What Is The Ttl (time To Live)? Why Is It Required?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>TTL is a value in data packet of Internet Protocol. It communicates to the network router whether or not the packet should be in the network for too long or discarded. Usually, data packets might not be transmitted to their intended destination within a stipulated period of time. The TTL value is set by a system default value which is an 8-bit binary digit field in the header of the packet. The purpose of TTL is, it would specify certain time limit in seconds, for transmitting the packet header. When the time is exhausted, the packet would be discarded. Each router receives the subtracts count, when the packet is discarded, and when it becomes zero, the router detects the discardedpackets and sends a message, Internet Control Message Protocol message back to the originating host.</p>
<p>TTL(time to live) apart from determining the life time of a packet in a network also helps in avoiding the wastage of bandwith</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques12"><strong>Question 13. Explain Ip Datagram, Fragmentation And Mtu ? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>IP datagram can be used to describe a portion of IP data. Each IP datagram has set of fields arranged in an order. The order is specific which helps to decode and read the stream easily. IP datagram has fields like Version, header length, Type of service, Total length, checksum, flag, protocol, Time to live, Identification, source and destination ip address, padding, options and payload.</p>
<p>MTU:- Maximum Transmission Unit is the size of the largest packet that a communication protocol can pass. The size can be fixed by some standard or decided at the time ofconnection</p>
<p>Fragmentation is a process of breaking the IP packets into smaller pieces. Fragmentation is needed when the datagram is larger than the MTU. Each fragment becomes a datagram in itself and transmitted independently from source. When received by destination they are reassembled.</p></p>

That Is A Bit Like Asking: How Much Does A Truck Cost?
</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The answer is that it depends on the truck. Your needs are unique and your app needs to meet only those needs. A small Toyota will cost a lot less than a huge semi tractor trailer. A tractor trailer is great if you want to haul goods across the country but dont try to take it on a Saturday night date. We help you to avoid creating too much - or too little app. This keeps costs low.</p>
<p>Having us create a custom smartphone app is surprisingly affordable. Many businesses find their app costs less than even a small radio or newspaper campaign. Unlike a radio campaign, the app?s usefulness does not end with the last commercial. Once it is created an app can add to your bottom line for a very long time. Our goal is to connect your audience with your cash register no matter where they are. With a smartphone app you give your customers access to you at the exact moment their buying decision is the strongest.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques52"><strong>Question 53. What Is An Uris?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Android uses URI strings both for requesting data (e.g., a list of contacts) and for requesting actions (e.g., opening a Web page in a browser). Both are valid URI strings, but have different values. All requests for data must start with the string ?content://?. Action strings are valid URIs that can be handled appropriately by applications on the device; for example, a URI starting with ?http://? will be handled by the browser.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques58"><strong>Question 59. What Is A Sticky Intent?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>sendStickyBroadcast() performs a sendBroadcast (Intent) that is "sticky," i.e. the Intent you are sending stays around after the broadcast is complete, so that others can quickly retrieve that data through the return value of registerReceiver (BroadcastReceiver, IntentFilter). In all other ways, this behaves the same as sendBroadcast (Intent).<br/>
One example of a sticky broadcast sent via the operating system is ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED. When you call registerReceiver () for that action -- even with a null BroadcastReceiver -- you get the Intent that was last broadcast for that action. Hence, you can use this to find the state of the battery without necessarily registering for all future state changes in the battery.</p></p>
