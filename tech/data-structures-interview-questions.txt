<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A data structure is a way of organizing data that considers not only the items stored, but also their relationship to each other. Advance knowledge about the relationship between data items allows designing of efficient algorithms for the manipulation of data.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques2"><strong>Question 3. What Does Abstract Data Type Mean?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Data type is a collection of values and a set of operations on these values. Abstract data type refer to the mathematical concept that define the data type.</p>
<p>It is a useful tool for specifying the logical properties of a data type.</p>
<p>ADT consists of two parts</p>
<p>1) Values definition<br/>
2) Operation definition</p>
<p>Example:-The value definition for the ADT RATIONAL states that RATIONAL value consists of two integers, second doesn’t equal to zero.</p>
<p>The operator definition for ADT RATIONAL includes the operation of creation (make rational) addition, multiplication and test for equality.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>After a call to free(p) makes a subsequent reference to *p illegal, i.e. though the storage to p is freed but the value of p(address) remain unchanged .so the object at that address may be used as the value of *p (i.e. there is no way to detect the illegality).Here p is called dangling pointer.</p>
<p>To avoid this it is better to set p to NULL after executing free(p).The null pointer value doesn’t reference a storage location it is a pointer that doesn’t point to anything.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Allocating memory at runtime is called a dynamically allocating memory. In this, you dynamically allocate memory by using the new operator when declaring the array.</p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>We can assign a memory address to an element of a pointer array by using the address operator, which is the ampersand (&amp;), in an assignment statement such as ptemployee[0] = &amp;projects[2];</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques61"><strong>Question 62. Why Do We Use A Multidimensional Array?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A multidimensional array can be useful to organize subgroups of  data within an array. In addition to organizing data stored in elements of an  array, a multidimensional array can store memory addresses of data in a pointer  array and an array of pointers.<br/>
<br/>
Multidimensional arrays are used to store information in a matrix form.</p>
<p>e.g; a railway timetable, schedule cannot be stored as a single dimensional  array. One can use a 3-D array for storing height, width and length of each room on  each floor of a building.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The symbol “*” tells the computer that you are declaring a pointer. Actually it depends on context.</p>
<p>In a statement like int *ptr; the ‘*’ tells that you are declaring a pointer.<br/> In a statement like int i = *ptr; it tells that you want to assign value pointed to by ptr to variable i.<br/>The symbol “*” is also called as Indirection Operator/ Dereferencing Operator.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques63"><strong>Question 64. Is Pointer A Variable?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Yes, a pointer is a variable and can be used as an element of a structure and as an attribute of a class in some programming languages such as C++, but not Java. However, the contents of a pointer is a memory address of another location of memory, which is usually the memory address of another variable, element of a structure, or attribute of a class.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques65"><strong>Question 66. How Memory Is Reserved Using A Declaration Statement ?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Memory is reserved using data type in the variable declaration. A programming language implementation has predefined sizes for its data types.</p>
<p><strong>For example:</strong> </p>
<p>in C# the declaration int i; will reserve 32 bits for variable i.<br/>A pointer declaration reserves memory for the address or the pointer variable, but not for the data that it will point to. The memory for the data pointed by a pointer has to be allocated at runtime.<br/>The memory reserved by the compiler for simple variables and for storing pointer address is allocated on the stack, while the memory allocated for pointer referenced data at runtime is allocated on the heap.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques66"><strong>Question 67. What Is Impact Of Signed Numbers On The Memory?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Sign of the number is the first bit of the storage allocated for that number. So you get one bit less for storing the number. For example if you are storing an 8-bit number, without sign, the range is 0-255. If you decide to store sign you get 7 bits for the number plus one bit for the sign. So the range is -128 to +127.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>When the minimum element is removed, a hole is created at the root. Since the heap now becomes one smaller, it follows that the last element X in the heap must move somewhere in the heap. If X can be placed in the hole, then we are done.. This is unlikely, so we slide the smaller of the hole’s children into the hole, thus pushing the hole down one level. We repeat this step until X can be placed in the hole. Thus, our action is to place X in its correct spot along a path from the root containing minimum children. This general strategy is known as percolate down.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>In a multiuser environment, the operating system scheduler must decide which of the several processes to run only for a fixed period of time. One algorithm uses queue. Jobs are initially placed at the end of the queue. The scheduler will repeatedly take the first job on the queue, run it until either it finishes or its time limit is up and place it at the end of the queue if it does not finish. This strategy is not appropriate, because very short jobs will soon to take a long time because of the wait involved in the run.</p>
<p>Generally, it is important that short jobs finish as fast as possible, so these jobs should have precedence over jobs that have already been running. Further more, some jobs that are not short are still very important and should have precedence. This particular application seems to require a special kind of queue, known as priority queue. Priority queue is also called as Heap or Binary Heap.</p></p>

<p><strong>Zig-Zig:</strong> If p is not the root, p is the  left child and v is also a left child, then a left-left rotation at g followed  by a left-left rotation at p, brings v as an ancestor of g as well as p.</p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>In binary search tree, the nodes are arranged in such a way that the left node is having less data value than root node value and the right nodes are having larger value than that of root. Because of this while searching any node the value of the target node will be compared with the parent node and accordingly either left sub branch or right sub branch will be searched.
