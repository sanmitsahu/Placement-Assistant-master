<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques2"><strong>Question 3. In What Way Does The Agile Testing /development Methodology Differs From The Other Testing /development Methodologies?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Anytime applying agile methodology, the testers /developers ensure that the whole process of testing /development is broke into as small steps as possible and just a small unit of code is tested /developed in each of this steps. The team of testers /developers is communicating consistently the results of their work, and changes the short term strategy and even the development plan on the go, based on the results of agile testing. Agile methodology encourages flexible and rapid response to change which should lead to a better end result.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques3"><strong>Question 4. How Is It Different To Traditional Waterfall Or The V Model?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The big difference is that in agile environment, testing is not a phase; it is an activity parallel to development.</p>
<ul>
<li>In agile environment, small features of software are delivered frequently, so testing activity should be parallel to development activity. Testing time is short as we are only testing small features.</li>
<li>In the waterfall model, there is a testing phase at the end of the development so, testing is a big effort done after the whole application is developed. Testing time is long as we have to test the whole application.</li>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques8"><strong>Question 9. What Is Scrum?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Scrum is an innovative approach to getting work done in efficient way. It is iterative &amp; incremental agile software development method. These iterations are time boxed with various iterations &amp; each iteration is called Sprint. According to latest surveys Scrum is the most popular agile project management methodology in software development. The term Scrum is formed from Rugby.</p>
<p>Scrum is ideally used where highly emergent or rapidly changing requirements. Scrum is basically worked on a self-organizing, cross-functional team. In the overall scrum team there is no team leader who assign the task to team rather whole scrum members work as a team &amp; they decides the task on which they will work on. Also the problem will be resolve by team.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques10"><strong>Question 11. What Is Sprint?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Sprint is a predefined interval or the time frame in which the work has to be completed and make it ready for review or ready for production deployment. This time box usually lies between 2 weeks to 1 month. In our day to day life when we say that we follow 1 month Sprint cycle, it simply means that we work for one month on the tasks and make it ready for review by the end of that month.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A test stub is a bit of code that replaces an undeveloped or fully developed component within a system being tested. The test stub is built such that it mimics the actual component by generating specific known outputs. The stub can be used as a substitute for the actual (fully developed) component for testing purposes. The stub can also be used during testing to isolate system components and troubleshoot problems. A test stub is also known as a test double.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>QA can add a lot of value to an agile team because of the different mindset. Testers can and should think about the different possible scenarios to test a story.</p>
<p><strong>However the most important asset that they can bring is:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To prevent defect:</strong> A should advocate best practices along the way to prevent defects from entering the system in the first place.</li>
<li><strong>To provide fast feedback:</strong> It is important for developers to know if the new functionality works as expected and if regression tests pass, and they need that feedback quite quickly. QA should provide the results of the tests to developers as soon as possible.</li>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques26"><strong>Question 27. What Are The Disadvantages Of Agile Models?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>In case of some software deliverables, especially the large ones, it is difficult to assess the effort required at the beginning of the software development life cycle.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is lack of emphasis on necessary designing and documentation.</li>
<li>The project can easily get taken off track if the customer representative is not clear what final outcome that they want.</li>
<li>Only senior programmers are capable of taking the kind of decisions required during the development process. Hence it has no place for newbie programmers, unless combined with experienced resources.</li>
