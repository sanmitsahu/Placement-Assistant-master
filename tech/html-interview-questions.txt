<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques3"><strong>Question 4. How Do I Create Frames? What Is A Frameset? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Frames allow an author to divide a browser window into multiple (rectangular) regions. Multiple documents can be displayed in a single window, each within its own frame. Graphical browsers allow these frames to be scrolled independently of each other, and links can update the document displayed in one frame without affecting the others. </p>
<p>You can't just "add frames" to an existing document. Rather, you must create a frameset document that defines a particular combination of frames, and then display your content documents inside those frames. The frameset document should also include alternative non-framed content in a NOFRAMES element.  The HTML 4 frames model has significant design flaws that cause usability problems for web users. Frames should be used only with great care.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques4"><strong>Question 5. How Can I Include Comments In Html? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Technically, since HTML is an SGML application, HTML uses SGML comment syntax. However, the  full syntax is complex, and browsers don't support it in its entirety anyway. Therefore, use the following simplified rule to create HTML comments that both have valid syntax and work in browsers:<br/>
<br/>
An HTML comment begins with "&lt;!--", ends with  "--&gt;", and does not contain "--" or "&gt;" anywhere in the comment. <br/>
The following are examples of HTML comments:<br/>
<br/>
* &lt;!-- This is a comment. --&gt;<br/>
* &lt;!-- This is another comment,<br/>
and it continues onto a second line. --&gt;<br/>
* &lt;!----&gt;<br/>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>According to HTML standards, each HTML document begins with a DOCTYPE declaration that specifies which version of HTML the document uses. Originally, the DOCTYPE declaration was used only by SGML-based tools like HTML validators, which needed to determine which version of HTML a document used (or claimed to use).<br/>
Today, many browsers use the document's DOCTYPE declaration to determine whether to use a stricter, more standards-oriented layout mode, or to use a "quirks" layout mode that attempts to emulate older, buggy browsers.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques8"><strong>Question 9. Can I Nest Tables Within Tables? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Yes, a table  can be embedded inside a cell in another table. Here's a simple example: <br/>
<br/>
&lt;table&gt;<br/>
&lt;tr&gt;<br/>
&lt;td&gt;this is the first cell of the outer  table&lt;/td&gt;<br/>
&lt;td&gt;this is the second cell of the outer table,<br/>
<br/>
with the inner table embedded in it<br/>
&lt;table&gt;<br/>
&lt;tr&gt;<br/>
&lt;td&gt;this is the first cell of the inner  table&lt;/td&gt;<br/>
&lt;td&gt;this is the second cell of the inner  table&lt;/td&gt;<br/>
&lt;/tr&gt;<br/>
&lt;/table&gt;<br/>
&lt;/td&gt;<br/>
&lt;/tr&gt;<br/>
&lt;/table&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The main caveat about nested tables is that older versions of Netscape Navigator have problems with them if you don't explicitly close your TR, TD, and TH elements. To avoid problems, include every &lt;/tr&gt;,  &lt;/td&gt;, and &lt;/th&gt; tag, even though the HTML specifications don't require them. Also, older versions of Netscape Navigator have problems with tables that are nested extremely deeply (e.g., tables nested ten deep). To avoid problems, avoid nesting tables more than a few deep. You may be able to use the ROWSPAN and COLSPAN attributes to minimize table nesting. Finally, be especially sure to validate your markup whenever you use nested tables.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>You can use &lt;TABLE ALIGN="right"&gt; to float a table to the right. (Use ALIGN="left" to float it to the left.) Any content that follows the closing &lt;/TABLE&gt; tag will flow around the table.

The table in this example will float to the right.<br/>
&lt;table align="right"&gt;...&lt;/table&gt;<br/>
This text will wrap to fill the available space to the left of (and if the text is long enough, below) the table.<br/>
&lt;br clear="right"&gt;<br/>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Small forms are sometimes placed within a TD element within a table. This can be a useful for positioning a form relative to other content, but it doesn't help position the form-related elements relative to each other. <br/>
To position form-related elements relative to each other, the entire table must be within the form. You cannot start a form in one TH or TD element and end in another. You cannot place the form within the table without placing it inside a TH or TD element. You can put the table inside the form, and then use the table to position the INPUT, TEXTAREA, SELECT, and other form-related elements, as shown in the following example. <br/>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques13"><strong>Question 14. How Can I Check For Errors? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>HTML validators check HTML documents against a formal definition of HTML syntax and then output a list of errors. Validation is important to give the best chance of correctness on unknown browsers (both existing browsers that you haven't seen and future browsers that haven't been written yet). </p>
<p>HTML checkers (linters) are also useful. These programs check documents for specific problems, including some caused by invalid markup and others caused by common browser bugs. Checkers may pass some invalid documents, and they may fail some valid ones. </p>
<p>All validators are functionally equivalent; while their reporting styles may vary, they will find the same errors given identical input. Different checkers are programmed to look for different problems, so  their reports will vary significantly from each other. Also, some programs that are called validators (e.g. the "CSE HTML Validator") are really linters/checkers. They are still useful, but they should not be confused with real HTML validators. </p>
<p>When checking a site for errors for the first time, it is often useful to identify common problems that occur repeatedly in your markup. Fix these problems everywhere they occur (with an automated process if possible), and then go back to identify and fix the remaining problems. </p>
<p>Link checkers follow all the links on a site and report which ones are no longer functioning. CSS checkers report problems with CSS style sheets.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>If you want others to view your web page with specific colors, the most appropriate way is to suggest the colors with a style sheet. Cascading Style Sheets use the color and background-color properties to specify text and background colors. To avoid conflicts between the reader's default colors and those suggested by the author, these two properties should always be used together. </p>
<p>With HTML, you can suggest colors with the TEXT, LINK, VLINK (visited link), ALINK (active link), and BGCOLOR (background color) attributes of the BODY element. </p>
<p>Note that these attributes are deprecated by HTML 4. Also, if one of these attributes is used, then all of them should be used to ensure that the reader's default colors do not interfere with those suggested by the author. Here is an example: </p>
<p>&lt;body bgcolor="#ffffff"  text="#000000" link="#0000ff" vlink="#800080"  alink="#000080"&gt; <br/>

<br/>
* An HTTP server that accepts uploads.<br/>
* Access to the /cgi-bin/ to put the receiving script. Prewritten CGI file-upload scripts are available.<br/>
* A form implemented something like this:<br/>

Ideally, this error message should include a copy of the original form with the original (incomplete or incorrect) data filled in as the default values for the form fields. The Perl CGI.pm module provides helpful mechanisms for returning partially completed forms to the user. </p>

The image input type specifies a graphical submit button that functions like a server-side image map. </p>

<p>Note that these attributes are proprietary and not part of the HTML 4.01 specifications. (HTML 4.01 does define the FRAMEBORDER attribute for the FRAME element, but not for the FRAMESET element.)

</li><br><br><li class="quesans mb-20">
<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques32"><strong>Question 33. Why Aren't My Frames The Exact Size I Specified? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Older versions of Netscape Navigator seems to convert pixel-based frame dimensions to whole percentages, and to use those percentage-based dimensions when laying out the frames. Thus, frames with pixel-based dimensions will be rendered with a slightly different size than that specified in the frameset document. The rounding error will vary depending on the exact size of the browser window.  Furthermore, Navigator seems to store the percentage-based dimensions internally, rather than the original pixel-based dimensions. Thus, when a window is resized, the frames are redrawn based on the new window size and the old percentage-based dimensions.</p>
<p>There is no way to prevent this behavior. To accommodate it, you should design your site to adapt to variations in the frame dimensions. This is another situation where it is a good idea to accommodate variations in the browser's presentation.</p></p>

Unless the sound or movies file has a direct link to download and save the file to a specified location on your hard disk drive or to view your Internet browser's cache and locate the sound or movie file saved in the cache. <br/>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques35"><strong>Question 36. Is It Possible To Make The Html Source Not Viewable?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>In short, there is no real method or script for making standard HTML source code not viewable. You may consider doing any of the below if they are concerned about your source code.<br/>
1. Create the web page in Macromedia Flash or a similar program. The visitor would need to download the Macromedia Flash plug-in and would be unable to view the source code for the flash applet.<br/>
2. There are various scripts that will disable the right click feature, preventing the user from saving images or viewing the source. However, this will not protect the source code of your page. For example, Internet Explorer users may still click "View" and "Source" to view the source code of the page, or a user could disable scripts and images can be saved by simply saving the web page to the hard drive.<br/>
3. There are several programs that will help scramble your code, making it difficult (not impossible) to read. Again, this is not going to prevent someone from viewing your code.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>They are a few reasons that this could happen. The most common are:<br/>
<br/>
1. You're attempting to use a .bmp or .tif or other non-supported file format. You can only use .gif and .jpg on the web. You must convert files that are not .gif or .jpg into a .gif or .jpg with your image/graphics program.<br/>
2. You've forgotten to upload the graphic files. Double-Check.<br/>
3. You've incorrectly linked to the images. When you are starting out, try just using the file name in the &lt;img&gt; tag. If you have cat.jpg, use <br/>
img src="cat.jpg"&gt;.<br/>
4. Image file names are case-sensitive. If your file is called CaT.JpG, you cannot type cat.jpg, you must type CaT.JpG exactly in the  src.<br/>
5. If all of the above fail, re-upload the image in BINARY mode. You may have accidentally uploaded the image in ASCII mode.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques46"><strong>Question 47. Why Does The Browser Show My Plain Html Source? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>If Microsoft Internet Explorer displays your document normally, but other browsers display your plain HTML source, then most likely your web server is sending the document with the MIME type "text/plain". Your web server needs to be configured to send that filename with the MIME type "text/html". Often, using the filename extension ".html" or ".htm" is all that is necessary. If you are seeing this behavior while viewing your HTML documents on your local Windows filesystem, then your text editor may have added a ".txt" filename extension automatically. You should rename filename.html.txt to filename.html so that Windows will treat the file as an HTML document.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques48"><strong>Question 49. Why Do My Links Open New Windows Rather Than Update An Existing Frame? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>If there is no existing frame with the name you used for the TARGET attribute, then a new browser window will be opened, and this window will be assigned the name you used. Furthermore, TARGET="_blank" will open a new, unnamed browser window.</p>
<p>In HTML 4, the TARGET attribute value is case-insensitive, so that abc and ABC both refer to the same frame/window, and _top and _TOP both have the same meaning. However, most browsers treat the TARGET attribute value as case-sensitive and do not recognize ABC as being the same as abc, or _TOP as having the special meaning of _top. </p>
<p>Also, some browsers include a security feature that prevents documents from being hijacked by third-party framesets. In these browsers, if a document's link targets a frame defined by a frameset document that is located on a different server than the document itself, then the link opens in a new window instead.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The only way to have a frame with a vertical scrollbar but without a horizontal scrollbar is to define the frame with SCROLLING="auto" (the default), and to have content that does not require horizontal scrolling. There is no way to specify that a frame should have one scrollbar but not the other. Using SCROLLING="yes" will force scrollbars in both directions (even when they aren't needed), and using SCROLLING="no" will inhibit all scrollbars (even when scrolling is necessary to access the frame's content).

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>DIV is used to select a block of text so that one can apply styles to it. SPAN is used to select inline text and let users to apply styles to it.  The main difference between DIV and SPAN is SPAN does not do formatting by itself. Also the DIV tag is used as a paragraph break as it creates a logical division of the document in which it is applied. This is in contrast to the SPAN as SPAN simply dos the functionality of applying the style and alignment whatever was specified in it. DIV has ALIGN attribute in it which is not present in case of SPAN. Thus DIV is used in cases where one wants to apply styles to a block of text. But there may be situations in which there might not be clear well structured block of text to work with. In those cases one can opt to apply SPAN which is used to apply styles inline. That is in other words DIV is generally used for block of text and SPAN is generally used for words or sentences.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>That'll be the pages with more content? The ones that have a  vertical scrollbar? If you look in IE there's probably a white space on the  right where there would be a scrollbar if there were enough content to require  one. In Firefox, the scrollbar appears when it's needed and the viewport  becomes about 20px smaller, so the content seems to shift to the left when you  move from a page with little content to one with lots of content. It's not a  bug or something that needs to be fixed, but it does confuse and irritate some  developers.<br/>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques77"><strong>Question 78. How Do I Design For Backward Compatibility Using Style Sheets? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Existing HTML style methods (such as &lt;font SIZE&gt; and  &lt;b&gt;) may be easily combined with style sheet specification methods.  Browsers that do not understand style sheets will use the older HTML formatting  methods, and style sheets specifications can control the appearance of these  elements in browsers that support CSS1.</p></p>
</li><br><br><li class="quesans mb-20">
<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques78"><strong>Question 79. Why Use Style Sheets? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Style sheets allow a much greater degree of layout and display control than has ever been possible thus far in HTML. The amount of format coding necessary to control display characteristics can be greatly reduced through the use of external style sheets which can be used by a group of documents. Also, multiple style sheets can be integrated from different sources to form a cohesive tapestry of styles for a document. Style sheets are also backward compatible - They can be mixed with HTML styling elements and attributes so that older browsers can view content as intended.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques79"><strong>Question 80. What Is Css Rule 'at-rule'? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>There are two types of CSS rules: ruleset and at-rule. At-rule is a rule that applies to the whole style sheet and not to a specific selector only (like in ruleset). They all begin with the @ symbol followed by a keyword made up of letters a-z, A-Z, digits 0-9, dashes and escaped characters, e.g. @import or @font-face.</p></p>
</li><br><br><li class="quesans mb-20">
<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques80"><strong>Question 81. What Is Selector? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>CSS selector is equivalent of HTML element(s). It is a string identifying to which element(s) the corresponding declaration(s) will apply and as such the link between the HTML document and the style sheet.</p>
<p>For example in P {text-indent: 10pt} the selector is P and is called type selector as it matches all instances of this element type in the document.</p>
<p>in P, UL {text-indent: 10pt} the selector is P and UL (see grouping); in .class {text-indent: 10pt} the selector is .class (see class selector).</p></p>
</li><br><br><li class="quesans mb-20">
<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques81"><strong>Question 82. What Is Css Declaration? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>CSS declaration is style attached to a specific selector. It consists of two parts; property which is equivalent of HTML attribute, e.g. text-indent: and value which is equivalent of HTML value, e.g. 10pt. NOTE: properties are always ended with a colon.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques82"><strong>Question 83. What Is 'important' Declaration? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Important declaration is a declaration with increased weight.  Declaration with increased weight will override declarations with normal  weight. If both reader's and author's style sheet contain statements with  important declarations the author's declaration will override the reader's.<br/>
<br/>
BODY {background: white ! important; color: black}<br/>
<br/>
In the example above the background property has increased  weight while the color property has normal.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques83"><strong>Question 84. What Is Cascade? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Cascade is a method of defining the weight (importance) of  individual styling rules thus allowing conflicting rules to be sorted out  should such rules apply to the same selector. <br/>
<br/>
Declarations with increased weight take precedence over  declaration with normal weight:<br/>
<br/>
P {color: white ! important} /* increased weight */<br/>
P (color: black} /* normal weight */</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques84"><strong>Question 85. Are Style Sheets Case Sensitive? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>No. Style sheets are case insensitive. Whatever is case insensitive in HTML is also case insensitive in CSS. However, parts that are not under control of CSS like font family names and URLs can be case sensitive - IMAGE.gif and image.gif is not the same file.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>With CSS, you can use the background-repeat property. The  background repeat can be included in the short hand background property, as in  this example:<br/>
<br/>
body {<br/>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques86"><strong>Question 87. Styles Not Showing? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>There are different ways to apply CSS to a HTML document with a stylesheet, and these different ways can be combined:</p>
<p>* inline (internal) (Deprecated for XHTML)<br/>
* embedded (internal)<br/>
* linked (external) and<br/>
* @import (external)</p>
<p>Note: An external stylesheet is a text file that contains only CSS Styles. HTML comments are not supposed to be in there and can lead to misinterpretation (&gt; is the CSS "Child" selector!).</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques87"><strong>Question 88. How Do I Quote Font Names In Quoted Values Of The Style Attribute? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The attribute values can contain both single quotes and double  quotes as long as they come in matching pairs. If two pair of quotes are  required include single quotes in double ones or vice versa:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;P STYLE="font-family: 'New Times Roman';  font-size: 90%"&gt;<br/>
&lt;P STYLE='font-family: "New Times Roman";  font-size: 90%'&gt;<br/>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques88"><strong>Question 89. What Can Be Done With Style Sheets That Can Not Be Accomplished With Regular Html? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Many of the recent extensions to HTML have been tentative and somewhat crude attempts to control document layout. Style sheets go several steps beyond, and introduces complex border, margin and spacing control to most HTML elements. It also extends the capabilities introduced by most of the existing HTML browser extensions. Background colors or images can now be assigned to ANY HTML element instead of just the BODY element and borders can now be applied to any element instead of just to tables.

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Property is a stylistic parameter (attribute) that can be influenced through CSS, e.g. FONT or WIDTH. There must always be a corresponing value or values set to each property, e.g. font: bold or font: bold san-serif.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques90"><strong>Question 91. How Do I Write My Style Sheet So That It Gracefully Cascades With User's Personal Sheet ? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>You can help with this by setting properties in recommended places. Style rules that apply to the whole document should be set in the BODY element -- and only there. In this way, the user can easily modify document-wide style settings.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques91"><strong>Question 92. How Can I Make A Page Look The Same In E.g. Ns And Msie ? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The simple answer is, you can't, and you shouldn't waste your time trying to make it exactly the same. Web browsers are allowed, per definition, to interpret a page as they like, subject to the general rules set down in the HTML and CSS specifications. As a web author you can not have a prior knowledge of the exact situation and/or medium that will be used to render your page, and it's almost always rather counterproductive to try to control that process. There is no necessity for a well-written page to look the same in different browsers. You may want to strive to ensure that it looks good in more than one browser, even if the actual display (in the case of graphical browsers) comes out a bit different. "Looking good" can be achieved by adopting sensible design and guidelines, such as not fixing the size or face of your fonts, not fixing the width of tables, etc… Don't fight the medium; most web users only use one browser and will never know, or bother to find out, that your page looks different, or even "better", in any other browser.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques92"><strong>Question 93. Is There Anything That Can't Be Replaced By Style Sheets? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Quite a bit actually. Style sheets only specify information that controls display and rendering information. Virtual style elements that convey the NATURE of the content can not be replaced by style sheets, and hyperlinking and multimedia object insertion is not a part of style sheet functionality at all (although controlling how those objects appear IS part of style sheets functionality.) The CSS1 specification has gone out of its way to absorb ALL of the HTML functionality used in controlling display and layout characteristics. For more information on the possible properties in CSS, see the Index DOT Css Property Index.</p>
<p>Rule of Thumb: if an HTML element or attribute gives cues as to how its contents should be displayed, then some or all of its functionality has been absorbed by style sheets.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The CSS-names; names of selectors, classes and IDs can contain characters a-z, A-Z, digits 0-9, period, hyphen, escaped characters, Unicode characters 161-255, as well as any Unicode character as a numeric code.

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques95"><strong>Question 96. What Browsers Support Style Sheets? To What Extent? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Microsoft's Internet Explorer version 3.0 Beta 2 and above supports CSS, as does Netscape Communicator 4.0 Beta 2 and above and Opera 3.5 and above. Take note that the early implementations in these browsers did not support ALL of the properties and syntax described in the full CSS1 specification and beyond. Later versions have been getting much closer to full CSS1 compliance, but then comes the next hurdle - CSS2...it was such a big leap over CSS1 that it has taken the browsers years to come close to supporting a majority of CSS2's features. Mozilla and Opera's current versions both offer excellent CSS standards compliance. The Macintosh version of Internet Explorer is said to be very impressive in its CSS capabilities as well, but PC IE lags behind these implementations. Quite a few other implementations of CSS now exist in browsers that are not as widely-used (such as Amaya, Arena and Emacs-W3), but coverage of features in these documents currently only covers Internet Explorer, NCSA Mosaic, Netscape and Opera browsers.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques96"><strong>Question 97. Why Shouldn't I Use Fixed Sized Fonts ? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Only in very rare situations we will find users that have a "calibrated" rendering device that shows fixed font sizes correct. This tells us that we can never know the real size of a font when it's rendered on the user end. Other people may find your choice of font size uncomfortable. A surprisingly large number of people have vision problems and require larger text than the average. Other people have good eyesight and prefer the advantage of more text on the screen that a smaller font size allows. What is comfortable to you on your system may be uncomfortable to someone else. Browsers have a default size for fonts. If a user finds this inappropriate, they can change it to something they prefer. You can never assume that your choice is better for them. So, leave the font size alone for the majority of your text. If you wish to change it in specific places (say smaller text for a copyright notice at the bottom of page), use relative units so that the size will stay in relationship to what the user may have selected already. Remember, if people find your text uncomfortable, they will not bother struggling with your web site. Very few (if any) web sites are important enough to the average user to justify fighting with the author's idea of what is best.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Initial value is a default value of the property, that is the  value given to the root element of the document tree. All properties have an  initial value. If no specific value is set and/or if a property is not  inherited the initial value is used. For example the background property is not  inherited, however, the background of the parent element shines through because  the initial value of background property is transparent. <br/>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>That's part of the game. I don't think any specification has a birthright to be fully supported by all browsers. There should be healthy competition between different specifications. I believe simple, author-friendly specifications will prevail in this environment.</p>
<p>Microformats are another way of developing new formats. Instead of having to convince browser vendors to support your favorite specification, microformats add semantics to HTML through the CLASS attribute. And style it with CSS.</p></p>
