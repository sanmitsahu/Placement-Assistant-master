<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques1"><strong>Question 2. What Impacts Will The Internet Of Things (iot) Have On Infrastructure And Smart Cities Sector?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The capabilities of the smart grid, smart buildings, and ITS combined with IoT components in other public utilities, such as roadways, sewage and water transport and treatment, public transportation, and waste removal, can contribute to more integrated and functional infrastructure, especially in cities.</p>
<p>For example, traffic authorities can use cameras and embedded sensors to manage traffic flow and help reduce congestion. IoT components embedded in street lights or other infrastructure elements can provide functions such as advanced lighting control, environmental monitoring, and even assistance for drivers in finding parking spaces. Smart garbage cans can signal waste removal teams when they are full, streamlining the routes that garbage trucks take.</p>
<p>This integration of infrastructure and service components is increasingly referred to as smart cities, or other terms such as connected, digital, or intelligent cities or communities. A number of cities in the United States and elsewhere have developed smart-city initiatives.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques5"><strong>Question 6. How Is Industrial Internet Of Things (iiot) Different From The Internet Of Things (iot)?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>There are two perspectives on how the Industrial IoT differs from the IoT.</p>
<p>The first perspective is that there are two distinctly separate areas of interest. The Industrial IoT connects critical machines and sensors in high-stakes industries such as aerospace and defense, healthcare and energy. These are systems in which failure often results in life-threatening or other emergency situations. On the other hand, IoT systems tend to be consumer-level devices such as wearable fitness tools, smart home thermometers and automatic pet feeders. They are important and convenient, but breakdowns do not immediately create emergency situations.</p>
<p>The second perspective sees the Industrial IoT as the infrastructure that must be built before IoT applications can be developed. In other words, the IoT, to some extent, depends on the Industrial IoT.</p>
<p>For example, many networked home appliances can be classified as IoT gadgets, such as a refrigerator that can monitor the expiration dates of the milk and eggs it contains, and remotely-programmable home security systems. On the Industrial Internet side, utilities are enabling better load balancing by taking power management decisions down to the neighborhood level. What if they could go all the way down to individual appliances? Suppose users could selectively block power to their devices during high-demand scenarios? Your DVR might power down if it wasn’t recording your favorite show, but your refrigerator would continue to work, resulting in less food spoilage. You could set your washer and dryer to be non-functional, and make an exception with a quick call from your smartphone. Rolling blackouts could be a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Innovators are only beginning to imagine the possibilities that may be achieved by taking advantage of devices and systems that can communicate and act in real time, based on information they exchange amongst themselves. As the Industrial IoT becomes better defined and developed, more impactful IoT applications can and will be created.</p>
<p><strong>Internet of Things:-</strong></p>
<p>Everyday consumer-level devices connected to one another and made smarter and slightly self-aware.</p>
<p>Examples: consumer cell phone, smart thermostat</p>
<p><strong>Industrial Internet of Things:-</strong></p>
<p>Equipment and systems in industries and businesses where failures can be disastrous.</p>
<p>Examples: individual health monitors and alert systems in hospitals.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Several economic analyses have predicted that the IoT will contribute significantly to economic growth over the next decade, but the predictions vary substantially in magnitude. The current global IoT market has been valued at about $2 trillion, with estimates of its predicted value over the next five to ten years varying from $4 trillion to $11 trillion. Such variability demonstrates the difficulty of making economic forecasts in the face of various uncertainties, including a lack of consensus among researchers about exactly what the IoT is and how it will develop.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques9"><strong>Question 10. Why Internet Of Things(iot) Will Be Successful In The Coming Years?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>As the telecommunication sector is becoming more extensive and efficient, broadband internet is widely available. With technological advancement it is now much cheaper to produce necessary sensors with built-in wifi capabilities making connecting devices less costly.</p>
<p>Most important, the smart phone usage has surpassed all the predicted limits and telecommunication sector is already working on its toes to keep their customers satisfied by improving their infrastructure.As IoT devices need no separate communication than the existing one building IoT tech is very cheap and highly achievable.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques10"><strong>Question 11. How Cybersecurity Might Affect The Development And Implementation Of The Internet Of Things (iot), Especially In Usa?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The security of devices and the data they acquire, process, and transmit is often cited as a top concern in cyberspace. Cyberattacks can result in theft of data and sometimes even physical destruction. Some sources estimate losses from cyberattacks in general to be very large?in the hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars. As the number of connected objects in the IoT grows, so will the potential risk of successful intrusions and increases in costs from those incidents.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity involves protecting information systems, their components and contents, and the networks that connect them from intrusions or attacks involving theft, disruption, damage, or other unauthorized or wrongful actions. IoT objects are potentially vulnerable targets for hackers. Economic and other factors may reduce the degree to which such objects are designed with adequate cybersecurity capabilities built in. IoT devices are small, are often built to be disposable, and may have limited capacity for software updates to address vulnerabilities that come to light after deployment.</p>
<p>The interconnectivity of IoT devices may also provide entry points through which hackers can access other parts of a network. For example, a hacker might gain access first to a building thermostat, and subsequently to security cameras or computers connected to the same network, permitting access to and exfiltration or modification of surveillance footage or other information. Control of a set of smart objects could permit hackers to use their computing power in malicious networks called botnets to perform various kinds of cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Access could also be used for destruction, such as by modifying the operation of industrial control systems, as with the Stuxnet malware that caused centrifuges to self-destruct at Iranian nuclear plants. Among other things, Stuxnet showed that smart objects can be hacked even if they are not connected to the Internet. The growth of smart weapons and other connected objects within DOD has led to growing concerns about their vulnerabilities to cyberattack and increasing attempts to prevent and mitigate such attacks, including improved design of IoT objects. Cybersecurity for the IoT may be complicated by factors such as the complexity of networks and the need to automate many functions that can affect security, such as authentication. Consequently, new approaches to security may be needed for the IoT.</p>
<p>IoT cybersecurity will also likely vary among economic sectors and subsectors, given their different characteristics and requirements. Each sector will have a role in developing cybersecurity best practices, unique to its needs. The federal government has a role in securing federal information systems, as well as assisting with security of nonfederal systems, especially critical infrastructure. Cybersecurity legislation considered in the 114th Congress, while not focusing specifically on the IoT, would address several issues that are potentially relevant to IoT applications, such as information sharing and notification of data breaches.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques11"><strong>Question 12. What Impacts Will The Internet Of Things (iot) Have On Health Care Sector?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The IoT has many applications in the health care field, in both health monitoring and treatment, including telemedicine and telehealth. Applications may involve the use of medical technology and the Internet to provide long-distance health care and education. Medical devices, which can be wearable or nonwearable, or even implantable, injectable, or ingestible, can permit remote tracking of a patient’s vital signs, chronic conditions, or other indicators of health and wellness.36 Wireless medical devices may be used not only in hospital settings but also in remote monitoring and care, freeing patients from sustained or recurring hospital visits. Some experts have stated that advances in healthcare IoT applications will be important for providing affordable, quality care to the aging U.S. population.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques12"><strong>Question 13. What Are The Main Social And Cultural Impacts Of Internet Of Things (iot)?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The IoT may create webs of connections that will fundamentally transform the way people and things interact with each other. The emerging cyberspace platform created by the IoT and SMAC has been described as potentially making cities like “computers” in open air, where citizens engage with the city “in a real-time and ongoing loop of information.”</p>
<p>Some observers have proposed that the growth of IoT will result in a hyperconnected world in which the seamless integration of objects and people will cause the Internet to disappear as a separate phenomenon. In such a world, cyberspace and human space would seem to effectively merge into a single environment, with unpredictable but potentially substantial societal and cultural impacts.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques13"><strong>Question 14. Will Iot Actually Work Over The Internet Or Will It Have Its Own Dedicated Wide Area Network?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Interoperability between various wireless and networking standards is still an issue and something that forums and standards bodies are trying to address. According to Franks, businesses have to collaborate on standards to create strong ecosystems for a range of industries, otherwise the industry will remain fragmented.</p>
<p>“The IoT is a whole myriad of different ways of connecting things ? it could be fixed, Wi-Fi NFC, cellular, ultra-narrow band or even Zigbee. You have to mix and match what is best for each task,” he says. “Interoperability is essential, for economies of scale.”</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques14"><strong>Question 15. What Will Happen In Terms Of Jobs Losses And Skills As Iot Makes Devices And Robots More Intelligent?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A Digital Skills Select Committee report to the House of Lords in February estimated that 35% of UK jobs would be lost to automation in the next 20 years. It echoes the sort of thinking that Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee?s The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies predicts. Their answer is that you need to switch skills but to do this you need to switch the schools too.</p>
<p>Will Franks agrees. He saw when he launched his business in 2004 that a massive shortage in relevant skills can impede progress, so he was forced to look overseas. The same he says will happen with IoT unless we get schools and colleges to start gearing courses to meet the challenges of tomorrow?s automated economy.</p>
<p>It is a huge challenge and one which is a top three priority for Chi Onwuruh MP and Labour’s Digital Review. Digital inclusion, a data review and a focus on digital skills are she says essential.</p>
<p>Last July the Digital Skills Taskforce called for the Government to review skills development in schools and colleges. The Perkins Review in November last year also called for a review into developing engineering skills to boost the UK economy.</p>
<p>What is clear is that the jobs landscape will change dramatically in the next 20 years. But it will be a slow process and whether or not we are prepared to cope with it will depend as much on education policy as digital policy. The robots are definitely coming but don?t hand your notice in just yet.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques15"><strong>Question 16. What Are The Elements Of The Internet Of Everything?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>People: People will continue to connect through devices, like smartphones, PCs and tablets, as well as through social networks, such as Facebook and LinkedIn. As the Internet of Everything emerges, the interaction of people on the Internet will evolve. For example, it may become common to wear sensors on our skin or in our clothes that collect and transmit data to healthcare providers. Some analysts even suggest that people may become individual nodes that produce a constant stream of static data.</p>
<p>Process: This includes evolving technology, business, organizational and other processes that will be needed in order to manage and, to a large extent, automate the explosive growth in connections?and the resultant accumulation, analysis and communication of data?that will be inevitable in the Internet of Everything. Processes will also play an important role in how each of these entities?people, data, and things?interact with each other within the Internet of Everything to deliver societal benefits and economic value.</p>
<p>Things:This element includes many physical items like sensors, meters, actuators, and other types of devices that can be attached to any object, that are or will be capable of connecting to the network and sharing information. These things will sense and deliver more data, respond to control inputs, and provide more information to help people and machines make decisions. Examples of ?things? in the Internet of Everything include smart meters that communicate energy consumption, assembly line robots that automate factory floor operations, and smart transportation systems that adapt to traffic conditions.</p>
<p>Data: Today, devices typically gather data and stream it over the Internet to a central source, where it is analyzed and processed. Such data is expected to surpass today?s largest social media data set by another order of magnitude. Much of this data has very transient value. In fact, its value vanishes almost as quickly as it is created. As a result, not all generated data can be or should be stored. As the capabilities of things connected to the Internet continue to advance, they will become more intelligent and overcome the limits of traditional batch-oriented data analysis by combining data into more useful information. Rather than just reporting raw data, connected things will soon send higher-level information and insights back to machines, computers, and people in real time for further evaluation and decision making. The intelligent network touches everything?and is the only place where it?s possible to build the scalable intelligence required to meet and utilize this new wave of “data in motion”. This transformation made possible by the emergence of the Internet of Everything is important because it will enable faster, more intelligent decision making by both people and machines, as well as more effective control over our environment.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Many people mistakenly think of IoT as an independent technology. Interestingly, internet of things is being enabled by the presence of other independent technologies which make fundamental components of IoT.</p>
<p><strong>The fundamental components that make internet of things a reality are:-</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Hardware-Making physical objects responsive and giving them capability to retrieve data and respond to instructions</li>
<li>Software – Enabling the data collection, storage, processing, manipulating and instructing</li>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Like any other technology there are challenges which make the viability of IoT doubtful.</p>
<p>Security is one of the major concerns of experts who believe virtually endless connected devices and information sharing can severely compromise one?s security and well being. Unlike other hacking episodes which compromise online data and privacy with IoT devices can open gateway for an entire network to be hacked.</p>
<p>One such flaw is well presented by Andy Greenberg on wired.com where he works with hackers to remotely kill his Jeep on the highway. Another very relevant example is provided by W. David Stephenson in his post Amazon Echo: is it the smart home Trojan Horse? You can estimate the amount of personal and private data the connected devices will be producing once they are on a network. The major challenge for IoT tech companies is to figure out how the communication in the internet of things realm can be made truly secure.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques18"><strong>Question 19. What Kinds Of Information Do Internet Of Things (iot) Objects Communicate?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The answer depends on the nature of the object, and it can be simple or complex. For example, a smart thermometer might have only one sensor, used to communicate ambient temperature to a remote weather-monitoring center. A wireless medical device might, in contrast, use various sensors to communicate a person?s body temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and other variables to a medical service provider via a computer or mobile phone.</p>
<p>Smart objects can also be involved in command networks. For example, industrial control systems can adjust manufacturing processes based on input from both other IoT objects and human operators. Network connectivity can permit such operations to be performed in “real time” ? that is, almost instantaneously.</p>
<p>Smart objects can form systems that communicate information and commands among themselves, usually in concert with computers they connect to. This kind of communication enables the use of smart systems in homes, vehicles, factories, and even entire cities.</p>
<p>Smart systems allow for automated and remote control of many processes. A smart home can permit remote control of lighting, security, HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning), and appliances. In a smart city, an intelligent transportation system (ITS) may permit vehicles to communicate with other vehicles and roadways to determine the fastest route to a destination, avoiding traffic jams, and traffic signals can be adjusted based on congestion information received from cameras and other sensors.</p>
<p>Buildings might automatically adjust electric usage, based on information sent from remote thermometers and other sensors. An Industrial Internet application can permit companies to monitor production systems and adjust processes, remotely control and synchronize machinery operations, track inventory and supply chains, and perform other tasks.</p>
<p>IoT connections and communications can be created across a broad range of objects and networks and can transform previously independent processes into integrated systems. These integrated systems can potentially have substantial effects on homes and communities, factories and cities, and every sector of the economy, both domestically and globally.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Cyberattacks may also compromise privacy, resulting in access to and exfiltration of identifying or other sensitive information about an individual. For example, an intrusion into a wearable device might permit exfiltration of information about the location, activities, or even the health of the wearer.</p>
<p>In addition to the question of whether security measures are adequate to prevent such intrusions, privacy concerns also include questions about the ownership, processing, and use of such data. With an increasing number of IoT objects being deployed, large amounts of information about individuals and organizations may be created and stored by both private entities and governments.</p>
<p>With respect to government data collection, the U.S. Supreme Court has been reticent about making broad pronouncements concerning society?s expectations of privacy under the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution while new technologies are in flux, as reflected in opinions over the last five years.</p>
<p>Congress may also update certain laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, given the ways that privacy expectations of the public are evolving in response to IoT and other new technologies. IoT applications may also create challenges for interpretation of other laws relating to privacy, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and various state laws, as well as established practices such as those arising from norms such as the Fair Information Practice Principles.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques31"><strong>Question 32. How Does The Internet Of Things (iot) Work?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The IoT is not separate from the Internet, but rather, a potentially huge extension and expansion of it. The ?things? that form the basis of the IoT are objects. They could be virtually anything? streetlights, thermostats, electric meters, fitness trackers, factory equipment, automobiles, unmanned aircraft systems (UASs or drones), or even cows or sheep in a field. What makes an object part of the IoT is embedded or attached computer chips or similar components that give the object both a unique identifier and Internet connectivity. Objects with such components are often called “smart”?such as smart meters and smart cars.</p>
<p>Internet connectivity allows a smart object to communicate with computers and with other smart objects. Connections of smart objects to the Internet can be wired, such as through Ethernet cables, or wireless, such as via a Wi-Fi or cellular network.</p>
<p>To enable precise communications, each IoT object must be uniquely identifiable. That is accomplished through an Internet Protocol (IP) address, a number assigned to each Internet-connected device, whether a desktop computer, a mobile phone, a printer, or an IoT object. Those IP addresses ensure that the device or object sending or receiving information is correctly identified.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques32"><strong>Question 33. What Impacts Will The Internet Of Things (iot) Have On Energy Sector?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Within the energy sector, the IoT may impact both production and delivery, for example through facilitating monitoring of oil wellheads and pipelines. When IoT components are embedded into parts of the electrical grid, the resulting infrastructure is commonly referred to as the “smart grid”. This use of IoT enables greater control by utilities over the flow of electricity and can enhance the efficiency of grid operations. It can also expedite the integration of microgenerators into the grid.</p>
<p>Smart-grid technology can also provide consumers with greater knowledge and control of their energy usage through the use of smart meters in the home or office. Connection of smart meters to a building’s HVAC, lighting, and other systems can result in “smart buildings” that integrate the operation of those systems. Smart buildings use sensors and other data to automatically adjust room temperatures, lighting, and overall energy usage, resulting in greater efficiency and lower energy cost. Information from adjacent buildings may be further integrated to provide additional efficiencies in a neighborhood or larger division in a city.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The IoT can be leveraged by the agriculture industry through precision agriculture, with the goal of optimizing production and efficiency while reducing costs and environmental impacts. For farming operations, it involves analysis of detailed, often real-time data on weather, soil and air quality, water supply, pest populations, crop maturity, and other factors such as the cost and availability of equipment and labor. Field sensors test soil moisture and chemical balance, which can be coupled with location technologies to enable precise irrigation and fertilization. Drones and satellites can be used to take detailed images of fields, giving farmers information about crop yield, nutrient deficiencies, and weed locations.</p>
<p>For ranching and animal operations, radio frequency identification (RFID) chips and electronic identification readers (EID) help monitor animal movements, feeding patterns, and breeding capabilities, while maintaining detailed records on individual animals.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>With so many companies working on different products, technologies and platforms, making all these devices communicate with each other is no small feat ? seamless overall compatibility likely won?t happen.</p>
<p>Several groups are working to create an open standard that would allow interoperability among the various products. Among them are the AllSeen Alliance, whose members include Qualcomm, LG, Microsoft, Panasonic and Sony; and the Open Interconnect Consortium, which has the support of Intel, Cisco, GE, Samsung and HP.</p>
<p>While their end goal is the same, there are some differences to overcome. For example, the OIC says the AllSeen Alliance doesn?t do enough in the areas of security and intellectual property protection. The AllSeen Alliance says that these issues have not been a problem for its more than 110 members.</p>
<p>It?s not clear how the standards battle will play out, though many believe we?ll end up with three to four different standards rather than a single winner (think iOS and Android).</p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Generally speaking, M2M could be considered a subset of IoT. M2M is like a line connecting 2 points, and IoT is like a network, a system composed of lots of M2M and triggering lots of interactions/activities.</p>
<p>Giving a simple definition to M2M which is transferring data from one machine to another one. It’s been used everywhere in our daily life. For example, entrance security. Just like using your employee card to unlock a door. When the security detector receives the ID from the employee card and then unlock the door once the ID is approved. This is M2M.</p>
<p>In this case, what IoT can offer? As mentioned, IoT is a network, is a system composed of lots of M2M and algorithms. When the system knows you are the person entering the office, it can turn on the light and the air conditioner of your partition, even it can adjust the most comfortable light level and temperature that you like the most from time to time after learning your behavior for a period of time. The system can get all the data from all the sensors and machines to know, for example, who and when enters the office, how much electricity you have consumed, what the environment makes you feel most comfortable, and other applications.</p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The term Internet of Things is 16 years old. But the actual idea of connected devices had been around longer, at least since the 70s. Back then, the idea was often called “embedded internet” or “pervasive computing”. But the actual term “Internet of Things” was coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999 during his work at Procter&amp;Gamble.

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques46"><strong>Question 47. How Internet Addresses (ipv6) Might Affect The Development And Implementation Of The Internet Of Things (iot)?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A potential barrier to the development of IoT is the technical limitations of the version of the Internet Protocol (IP) that is used most widely. IP is the set of rules that computers use to send and receive information via the Internet, including the unique address that each connected device or object must have to communicate. Version 4 (IPv4) is currently in widest use. It can accommodate about four billion addresses, and it is close to saturation, with few new addresses available in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>Some observers predict that Internet traffic will grow faster for IoT objects than any other kind of device over the next five years, with more than 25 billion IoT objects in use by 2020,76 and perhaps 50 billion devices altogether. IPv4 appears unlikely to meet that growing demand, even with the use of workarounds such as methods for sharing IP addresses.</p>
<p>Version 6 (IPv6) allows for a huge increase in the number IP addresses. With IPv4, the maximum number of unique addresses, 4.2 billion, is not enough to provide even one address for each of the 7.3 billion people on Earth. IPv6, in contrast, will accommodate over 1038 addresses ? more than a trillion trillion per person.</p>
<p>It is highly likely that to accommodate the anticipated growth in the numbers of Internet-connected objects, IPv6 will have to be implemented broadly. It has been available since 1999 but was not formally launched until 2012. In most countries, fewer than 10% of IP addresses were in IPv6 as of September 2015. Adoption is highest in some European countries and in the United States, where adoption has doubled in the past year to about 20%.</p>
<p>Globally, adoption has doubled annually since 2011, to about 7% of addresses in mid-2015. While growth in adoption is expected to continue, it is not yet clear whether the rate of growth will be sufficient to accommodate the expected growth in the IoT. That will depend on a number of factors, including replacement of some older systems and applications that cannot handle IPv6 addresses, resolution of security issues associated with the transition, and availability of sufficient resources for deployment.</p>
<p>Efforts to transition federal systems to IPv6 began more than a decade ago. According to estimates by NIST, adoption for public-facing services has been much greater within the federal government than within industry or academia. However, adoption varies substantially among agencies, and some data suggest that federal adoption plateaued in 2012. Data were not available for this report on domains that are not public-facing, and it is not clear whether adoption of IPv6 by federal agencies will affect their deployment of IoT applications.</p></p>
