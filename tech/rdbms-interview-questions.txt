<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques0"><strong>Question 1. What Is Rdbms?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Relational Data Base Management Systems (RDBMS) are database management systems that maintain data records and indices in tables. Relationships may be created and maintained across and among the data and tables. In a relational database, relationships between data items are expressed by means of tables. Interdependencies among these tables are expressed by data values rather than by pointers. This allows a high degree of data independence. An RDBMS has the capability to recombine the data items from different files, providing powerful tools for data usage.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques1"><strong>Question 2. What Is Normalization?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Database normalization is a data design and organization process applied to data structures based on rules that help build relational databases. In relational database design, the process of organizing data to minimize redundancy. Normalization usually involves dividing a database into two or more tables and defining relationships between the tables. The objective is to isolate data so that additions, deletions, and modifications of a field can be made in just one table and then propagated through the rest of the database via the defined relationships.</p></p>
</li><br><br><li class="quesans mb-20">
<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques2"><strong>Question 3. What Are Different Normalization Forms?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p><em><strong>1NF: </strong></em>Eliminate Repeating Groups Make a separate table for each set of related attributes, and give each table a primary key. Each field contains at most one value from its attribute domain.</p>
<p><em><strong>2NF:</strong></em> Eliminate Redundant Data If an attribute depends on only part of a multi-valued key, remove it to a separate table.</p>
<p><em><strong>3NF: </strong></em>Eliminate Columns Not Dependent On Key If attributes do not contribute to a description of the key, remove them to a separate table. All attributes must be directly dependent on the primary key.</p>
<p><em><strong>BCNF: </strong></em>Boyce-Codd Normal Form If there are non-trivial dependencies between candidate key attributes, separate them out into distinct tables.</p>
<p><em><strong>4NF:</strong></em> Isolate Independent Multiple Relationships No table may contain two or more 1:n or n:m relationships that are not directly related.</p>
<p><em><strong>5NF: </strong></em>Isolate Semantically Related Multiple Relationships There may be practical constrains on information that justify separating logically related many-to-many relationships.</p>
<p><em><strong>ONF:</strong></em> Optimal Normal Form A model limited to only simple (elemental) facts, as expressed in Object Role Model notation.</p>
<p><em><strong>DKNF:</strong></em> Domain-Key Normal Form A model free from all modification anomalies. Remember, these normalization guidelines are cumulative. For a database to be in 3NF, it must first fulfill all the criteria of a 2NF and 1NF database.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques3"><strong>Question 4. What Is Stored Procedure?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A stored procedure is a named group of SQL statements that have been previously created and stored in the server database. Stored procedures accept input parameters so that a single procedure can be used over the network by several clients using different input data. And when the procedure is modified, all clients automatically get the new version. Stored procedures reduce network traffic and improve performance. Stored procedures can be used to help ensure the integrity of the database.<br/>
e.g. sp_helpdb, sp_renamedb, sp_depends etc.</p></p>
</li><br><br><li class="quesans mb-20">
<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques4"><strong>Question 5. What Is Trigger?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A trigger is a SQL procedure that initiates an action when an event (INSERT, DELETE or UPDATE) occurs. Triggers are stored in and managed by the DBMS. Triggers are used to maintain the referential integrity of data by changing the data in a systematic fashion. A trigger cannot be called or executed; the DBMS automatically fires the trigger as a result of a data modification to the associated table. Triggers can be viewed as similar to stored procedures in that both consist of procedural logic that is stored at the database level. Stored procedures, however, are not event-drive and are not attached to a specific table as triggers are. Stored procedures are explicitly executed by invoking a CALL to the procedure while triggers are implicitly executed. In addition, triggers can also execute stored procedures.</p></p>
</li><br><br><li class="quesans mb-20">
<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques5"><strong>Question 6. What Is View?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A simple view can be thought of as a subset of a table. It can be used for retrieving data, as well as updating or deleting rows. Rows updated or deleted in the view are updated or deleted in the table the view was created with. It should also be noted that as data in the original table changes, so does data in the view, as views are the way to look at part of the original table. The results of using a view are not permanently stored in the database. The data accessed through a view is actually constructed using standard T-SQL select command and can come from one to many different base tables or even other views.</p></p>
</li><br><br><li class="quesans mb-20">
<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques6"><strong>Question 7. What Is Index?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>An index is a physical structure containing pointers to the data. Indices are created in an existing table to locate rows more quickly and efficiently. It is possible to create an index on one or more columns of a table, and each index is given a name. The users cannot see the indexes, they are just used to speed up queries. Effective indexes are one of the best ways to improve performance in a database application. A table scan happens when there is no index available to help a query. In a table scan SQL Server examines every row in the table to satisfy the query results. Table scans are sometimes unavoidable, but on large tables, scans have a terrific impact on performance. Clustered indexes define the physical sorting of a database table’s rows in the storage media. For this reason, each database table may have only one clustered index. Non-clustered indexes are created outside of the database table and contain a sorted list of references to the table itself.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques17"><strong>Question 18. What Is Data Independence?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Data independence means that “the application is independent of the storage structure and access strategy of data”. In other words, The ability to modify the schema definition in one level should not affect the schema definition in the next higher level.<br/>
Two types of Data Independence:</p>
<ul>
<li> Physical Data Independence: Modification in physical level should not affect the logical level.</li>
<li> Logical Data Independence: Modification in logical level should affect the view level.</li>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques18"><strong>Question 19. What Is A View? How It Is Related To Data Independence?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A view may be thought of as a virtual table, that is, a table that does not really exist in its own right but is instead derived from one or more underlying base table. In other words, there is no stored file that direct represents the view instead a definition of view is stored in data dictionary. Growth and restructuring of base tables is not reflected in views. Thus the view can insulate users from the effects of restructuring and growth in the database. Hence accounts for logical data independence.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Partial Key:<br/>
It is a set of attributes that can uniquely identify weak entities and that are related to same owner entity. It is sometime called as Discriminator.<br/>
<br/>
Alternate Key:<br/>
All Candidate Keys excluding the Primary Key are known as Alternate Keys.<br/>
<br/>
Artificial Key:<br/>
If no obvious key, either stand alone or compound is available, then the last resort is to simply create a key, by assigning a unique number to each record or occurrence. Then this is known as developing an artificial key.<br/>
<br/>
Compound Key:<br/>
If no single data element uniquely identifies occurrences within a construct, then combining multiple elements to create a unique identifier for the construct is known as creating a compound key.<br/>
<br/>
Natural Key:<br/>
When one of the data elements stored within a construct is utilized as the primary key, then it is called the natural key.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Subqueries, or nested queries, are used to bring back a set of rows to be used by the parent query. Depending on how the subquery is written, it can be executed once for the parent query or it can be executed once for each row returned by the parent query. If the subquery is executed for each row of the parent, this is called a correlated subquery. <br/>
A correlated subquery can be easily identified if it contains any references to the parent subquery columns in its WHERE clause. Columns from the subquery cannot be referenced anywhere else in the parent query. The following example demonstrates a non-correlated subquery. <br/>
E.g. Select * From CUST Where '10/03/1990' IN (Select ODATE From ORDER Where CUST.CNUM = ORDER.CNUM)</p></p>

<ul>
<li> Database files</li>

</ul>
<p>The most important of these are the database files where the actual data resides. The control files and the redo logs support the functioning of the architecture itself. <br/>
All three sets of files must be present, open, and available to Oracle for any data on the database to be useable. Without these files, you cannot access the database, and the database administrator might have to recover some or all of the database using a backup, if there is one.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques88"><strong>Question 89. What Is Rowid?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The ROWID is a unique database-wide physical address for every row on every table. Once assigned (when the row is first inserted into the database), it never changes until the row is deleted or the table is dropped. <br/>
The ROWID consists of the following three components, the combination of which uniquely identifies the physical storage location of the row.</p>
<ul>
<li> Oracle database file number, which contains the block with the rows</li>
<li> Oracle block address, which contains the row</li>
<li> The row within the block (because each block can hold many rows)</li>
</ul>
<p>The ROWID is used internally in indexes as a quick means of retrieving rows with a particular key value. Application developers also use it in SQL statements as a quick way to access a row once they know the ROWID.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques89"><strong>Question 90. What Is Oracle Block? Can Two Oracle Blocks Have The Same Address?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Oracle "formats" the database files into a number of Oracle blocks when they are first created—making it easier for the RDBMS software to manage the files and easier to read data into the memory areas.<br/>
The block size should be a multiple of the operating system block size. Regardless of the block size, the entire block is not available for holding data; Oracle takes up some space to manage the contents of the block. This block header has a minimum size, but it can grow. <br/>
These Oracle blocks are the smallest unit of storage. Increasing the Oracle block size can improve performance, but it should be done only when the database is first created. <br/>
Each Oracle block is numbered sequentially for each database file starting at 1. Two blocks can have the same block address if they are in different database files.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A database trigger is a PL/SQL block that can defined to automatically execute for insert, update, and delete statements against a table. The trigger can be defined to execute once for the entire statement or once for every row that is inserted, updated, or deleted. For any one table, there are twelve events for which you can define database triggers. A database trigger can call database procedures that are also written in PL/SQL.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques91"><strong>Question 92. Name Two Utilities That Oracle Provides, Which Are Use For Backup And Recovery.</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Along with the RDBMS software, Oracle provides two utilities that you can use to back up and restore the database. These utilities are Export and Import. <br/>
The Export utility dumps the definitions and data for the specified part of the database to an operating system binary file. The Import utility reads the file produced by an export, recreates the definitions of objects, and inserts the data.<br/>
If Export and Import are used as a means of backing up and recovering the database, all the changes made to the database cannot be recovered since the export was performed. The best you can do is recover the database to the time when the export was last performed.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques93"><strong>Question 94. Does Pl/sql Support "overloading"? Explain</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The concept of overloading in PL/SQL relates to the idea that you can define procedures and functions with the same name. PL/SQL does not look only at the referenced name, however, to resolve a procedure or function call. The count and data types of formal parameters are also considered. <br/>
PL/SQL also attempts to resolve any procedure or function calls in locally defined packages before looking at globally defined packages or internal functions. To further ensure calling the proper procedure, you can use the dot notation. Prefacing a procedure or function name with the package name fully qualifies any procedure or function reference.</p></p>
