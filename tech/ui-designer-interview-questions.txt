<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><ul>
<li>Similarly to wire framing, prototyping is, more often than not, provided by the UX designer. Therefore, any UI designer should be aware of why prototyping takes place, and how to utilize it, in the workflow.</li>
<li>Put simply, prototyping is for design exploration and time saving purposes. To make sure UI designers don’t waste their time designing and redesigning specific user interactions, prototypes are used to create mockups of how design elements will be used.</li>
<li>Prototypes allow UI designers to identify any potential issues that might come in conflict with what the UX designer or architect has intended.</li>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques1"><strong>Question 2. How Do You Collaborate With Ux Designer(s) And Developer(s)?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Your prospective user-interface designer should feel comfortable answering this question, mainly because both UX and UI designers are design focused, so quite often they understand each other without much explanation.</p>
<p>When UI designers need to adjust, change, add or remove something provided by UX designer, they should focus their communication on wireframes, UI elements, personas and on how it will affect the entire user journey. UI and UX designers should also test the product and give feedback to the developer during development stages.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques2"><strong>Question 3. What Is Aesthetic-usability Effect?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>This is a phenomenon that states that a good-looking design will always be perceived as more usable than one that is less appealing, even though that might not be the case.</p>
<p>This phenomenon was demonstrated by two researchers, Kaori Kashmir and Masaki Kurusu, in their study at Hitachi in Tokyo. They asked test participants to rate the beauty and usability of interfaces. The final study results proved that even when trying to evaluate the interface in its functional aspects, the user would still end up strongly affected by the aesthetic aspect of the interface.</p>
<p>A good UI designer will keep in mind that this effect might easily influence a user’s opinion more than expected. This, in turn, might affect a user’s behavior and their perception of how easy it is to use the designed system.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques3"><strong>Question 4. What Is Atomic Design And Its Five Components?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>This is a fairly recent, yet widely recognized methodology introduced by Brad Frost in 2013. Atomic Design was created to design interfaces that focus on designing elements and their combinations, rather than designing web pages one by one. This is a basic explanation of what this methodology was created for. Knowing all five of its components should give your prospective designer some golden bonus points.</p>
<p><strong>Atoms:</strong> These are the smallest and most basic building blocks. These are applied to web interfaces as labels, input fields, text boxes, buttons, etc. They can also contain color, palettes, fonts, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Molecules:</strong> When atoms are combined, we get molecules: groups of atoms, bonded together that are the smallest fundamental units of a compound. Molecules can take on their own properties, too.</p>
<p><strong>Organisms:</strong> Organisms are formed by using molecules as our building blocks. When molecules are joined together, it becomes a relatively complex and distinct section of an interfaces that has been created: an organism.</p>
<p><strong>Templates:</strong> This stage should already make sense to clients. Understandably, templates are mostly groups of organisms put together to form pages. This is the stage that allows us to see things, such as layouts, coming together.</p>
<p><strong>Pages:</strong> This is used as specific instances of templates to give a precise understanding of what the final output will look like. Pages ultimately become the highest level of fidelity, which allows UX and UI designers, together, to test the effectiveness of the design system.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques4"><strong>Question 5. How Do You Make Sure You Stay Up-to-date With Industry Standards?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Digital design is always changing; its standards are always improving. So, the worst mistake your prospective designer could do is be out-of-date with the industry s/he represents.</p>
<p>A good answer to this question would include the candidate’s favorite resources, books, blogs, podcasts or YouTube channels s/he keeps an eye on for the latest industry information. It would also be useful to hear of designers that inspire the candidate.</p></p>
</li><br><br><li class="quesans mb-20">
<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques5"><strong>Question 6. What Is Call To Action (cta)? Should A Ui Designer Care About It?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>CTA is one of the most important, if not the most important, element of why websites, platforms, applications and digital interfaces are created. In short, it’s an element that will prompt a user to take a certain, desired action; actions such as buying products, downloading reports, sharing content, donating money, and so on. Part of the UX designer’s wireframe and prototype should identify the Call To Action that, ideally, will persuade users to engage.</p>
<p>A good UI designer should always notice CTA indications and should make sure that it gets a lot of attention when designing this element. Most of the time, it requires a specific and, more prominent color styling, different size, typography, placement and alignment, all of which UI designers control.</p></p>
</li><br><br><li class="quesans mb-20">
<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques6"><strong>Question 7. How Much Do You Know About Color Theory And Color Psychology?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><ul>
<li>Answering this question should never be a problem to a good UI designer. This is foundational thinking. Color theory is, basically, a set of guidelines and laws that are intended to trigger emotions, set moods and guide someone’s attention by using colors in very specific ways.</li>
<li>Essentially, color theory and psychology consist of two color groups: warm colors and cool colors. Warm colors, such as orange, yellow and red, are known to awaken enthusiasm, energy, positivity and happiness. Cool colors, green, purple and blue, create a trustworthy, calm, relaxing and peaceful environment.</li>
<li>Individual colors, too, have their own inherent abilities to awaken certain emotions. For example, red conveys the suggestion of danger, caution and hazard.</li>
<li>All in all, a good UI designer will always use the power of color theory and color psychology to strengthen the desired message.</li>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques7"><strong>Question 8. How Important Do You Think Element Mapping Is In The Work You Do?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Every good UI designer will design elements considering their shape, form, size, color, location and alignment. This means that your candidate should understand that element mapping is a crucial part of the design work.</p>
<p>Simply explained, mapping is the implied relationship between controls and their effects. If an element creates an effect that the user expects, then the element has good mapping.</p>
<p>For example, think about a set of images aligned horizontally that can be moved to the left or right. Underneath should be controls or buttons indicating that these images can be moved to either side. To move the images to the left side you would expect to click on the button aligned with the left side. Therefore, actually aligning this button to the left would, indeed, match the user’s expectations, which means this element has good mapping.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques8"><strong>Question 9. What Is Minimum Viable Product (mvp)?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><ul>
<li>Sometimes, designers create ego-centric work. It happens when all the UX requirements are met by the UI designer, but s/he continues adding design work to use his or her creativity, or to test out new practices, or to add elements that the designer feels are necessary, based on taste and preferences.</li>
<li>MVP works the opposite way; it means creating and designing a basic version of a product that early adopters can use or buy. The main goal is to bring the product to the market as soon as possible without any non-essential features.</li>
<li>Additional features and design elements are added based on the feedback of real users rather than a designer’s ideas and assumptions. Many of the world’s most popular products have been developed using MVP practice; Twitter is an example.</li>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques9"><strong>Question 10. Do You Think Mobile-first Design Is Effective, And Why?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Ideally, your candidate will explain that when Responsive Web Design (RWD) was introduced and gained popularity, Mobile-First Design practice was created to make the designer’s job more effective and efficient.</p>
<p>In this practice, designing starts from the smallest anticipated screen size and only then follow with enhancement on larger screen sizes. This approach saves time and increases a designer’s efficiency; when the design process starts with a large screen, designers tend to get into difficulty later trying to place elements onto smaller screens.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques10"><strong>Question 11. How Do You Apply Ockham’s Razor To Your Design Work?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>This principle is as simple as the Pareto Principle (also known as 80 / 20 rule). It simply says that whenever we have to make a decision between two options, the simplest should be selected.</p>
<p>UI designers use Occam’s razor when choosing between two designs or two design elements with the same function. Simplicity should always be chosen over complexity. Or in other words, s/he needs to choose the option which makes fewer assumptions.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>If not describing personal experience, your prospective UI designer should, at least, tell you in his or her own words what Participatory Design is and what it is used for.</p>
<p>Essentially, this term means having everyone (employees, partners, customers, stakeholders, end-users) involved in the design process to make sure that the end product matches their needs, expectations and can be freely used by them.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques12"><strong>Question 13. How Visual Weight Should Be Used Effectively?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><ul>
<li>Just like Call to Action (CTA) and Color Theory, Visual Weight is part of the fundamental knowledge a UI designer should have. Visual weight means giving a design element “power” to stand out and get user’s attention.</li>
<li>Not all elements have the same amount of “heaviness”. For example, CTA elements are more important than a simple label or an abstract image. Giving higher levels of “heavy” to certain elements are usually achieved by using contrast.</li>
<li>This isn’t necessarily a contrast of colors; it can be contrast of placement or size, too. A CTA button might look larger (or heavier) simply because it is designed to take up more space than surrounding elements. This puts more visual weight (more importance) on the CTA button.</li>
</ul></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques13"><strong>Question 14. Can You Walk Me Through Your Design Decisions?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>And finally, a great question to determine if your new designer knows how to make good design decisions. Ask the candidate to look at his or her portfolio, or a live product, website or application that s/he designed, and walk you through while describing different aspects and elements.</p>
<p>Ideally, you should expect to hear the designer’s reasons for why s/he decided to give buttons a certain size, shape, color, placement and alignment. All design thinking should be revealed by this question. It would show that everything s/he designs is intentional, not experimental or accidental.</p>
