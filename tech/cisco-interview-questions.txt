<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques0"><strong>Question 1. Have You Managed Heterogeneous Networks And Environments, Supporting Both Linux And Windows-based Networking?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p><strong>What most people say:</strong> This is not a yes or no question. Elaborate on your experience.</p>
<p><strong>What you should say:</strong> Describe the challenges hybrid environments pose, but don’t gloss over the problems or your struggles. Explain how you managed a tough situation or found an innovative solution.</p>
<p><strong>Why you should say it:</strong> The Linux Foundation’s Enterprise End User study has found that companies are deploying more Linux while keeping their Windows servers. That means you need to show proficiency in both.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques1"><strong>Question 2. What Are Some Examples Of Troubleshooting Methods You’ve Successfully Used In The Past?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p><strong>What most people say:</strong> Someone who’s never been in charge of a troubleshooting project and simply did what they were told might give a generic answer or outline some more traditional troubleshooting methods. That doesn’t make them stand out.</p>
<p><strong>What you should say:</strong> Every network issue is different, and say so. Then be specific about how you identified a particular problem and went about fixing it. For example, just mentioning that you’ve used the Top Down or Bottom Up approach is helpful, but offer specific details.</p>
<p><strong>Why you should say it:</strong> The details show the interviewer that you have specific and successful troubleshooting experience.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques2"><strong>Question 3. What Tools Do You Typically Use To Isolate And Troubleshoot Network Issues?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p><strong>What many people say:</strong> They list the names of the tools.</p>
<p><strong>What you should say:</strong> Explain your selection process and throw in something illustrating your diligence and attention to detail.</p>
<p><strong>Why you should say it:</strong> The interviewer wants to know more than the names, but also why you prefer them. This allows the manager to get a deeper understanding of your real knowledge of networking in all environments.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques3"><strong>Question 4. What Are Some Ways You’ve Improved Network Performance In The Past?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p><strong>What most people say:</strong> They talk about problems they’ve fixed in the past, but not necessarily how they’ve improved performance.</p>
<p><strong>What you should say:</strong> Qualified candidates usually have crowning moments to talk about, instances where they’ve taken on a project and seriously improved the network’s performance. You should jump on this question and answer it with strength and excitement.</p>
<p><strong>Why you should say it:</strong> Most companies are looking not only for network engineers who are not only problem-solvers, but people who can strengthen they networks and organization.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques4"><strong>Question 5. How Much Experience Do You Have Working With The Development Team As Well As The Sysadmin/networking Team?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p><strong>What most people say:</strong> The DevOps concept of integrating the development and operations teams is fairly new, so don’t fudge it if you’ve been on only one side or the other. These teams focus on shrinking development time, saving money and eliminating conflicts between developed projects and operational integration, and rely heavily on open communication.</p>
<p><strong>What you should say:</strong> Even if you haven’t been on such a team, here’s an opportunity to tell a story about a related skill, such as your ability to work closely with other units or to communicate effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Why you should say it:</strong> As these teams become more common, you’ll need to be able to articulate this experience or your willingness to dive in.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques5"><strong>Question 6. What Things Should Be Considered When Designing An Enterprise Network?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p><strong>What most people say:</strong> They mention some of the more generic things to be considered (which  can easily be found through a basic Internet search. Managers know that.).</p>
<p><strong>What you should say:</strong> Begin with, “That depends, because a cookie-cutter approach just won’t work when it comes to enterprise network design.” Then outline a specific enterprise network you’ve designed and its particular concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Why you should say it:</strong> This type of answer lets the interviewer know more about your specific level of experience rather than just your level of technical knowledge. In just about every case, experience trumps knowledge.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><ul>
<li><strong>What most people say:</strong> Usually that IPv6 is a problem that can be worked around with approaches like network address translation.</li>
<li><strong>What you should say:</strong> IPv6 is a real and definite channel that needs to be met head on.</li>
<li><strong>Why you should say it:</strong> It’s true and the answer sounds proactive.</li>
