<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques13"><strong>Question 14. Define Forward Biasing?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>When a diode is forward biased the current is produced because the holes in the P-region and electron from N-region moves towards the junction. The depletion region formed will be very small hence recombination occurs and current will be produced.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques21"><strong>Question 22. Define Transition Time?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Only after the minority carriers are swept of the junction the diode voltage begins to reverse and the diode current decreases exponentially the time which elapses between and when the diode normally recovered is the called transition time.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques22"><strong>Question 23. Define Storage Time?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>When the conduction diode is reverse biased the voltage does not become zero. Immediately up to time t 1 the diode is conducting in the forward direction. The time interval t = t 2 –t1 during which the stored minority carriers reduces to zero is called  storage time (t s).</p></p>
