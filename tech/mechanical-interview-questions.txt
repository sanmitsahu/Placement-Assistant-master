<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques433"><strong>Question 434. What Are The Causes Of Failure Of Boiler Tubes ?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Boiler tubes, usually are made from carbon steel and are subject to</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>high rates of heat transfer,</li>
<li>bending stresses due to uneven heating, especially at expanded or welded joints into headers or drums,</li>
<li>external erosion from burners and flue gas,</li>
<li>possible corrosion on the boiler side, and</li>
<li>occasional manufacturing defects.</li>
</ol>
<p>Failure may occur due to following reasons :</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>High thermal ratings may lead to rapid failure if the internal fluid flow is reduced for any reason. The resultant overheating leads to a failure by creep, characterised by the bulging of the tube with the eventual development of a longitudinal split.</li>
<li>Fatigue cracking due to bending stresses occur. These are associated with change of section and/or weld undercut, where tubes are expanded or welded into headers.</li>
<li>Failure may arise due to overstressing of a reduced section of metal.</li>
<li>Sudden failure of the boiler tube due to corrosion arises from embrittlement of the carbon steel due to interaction between atomic hydrogen from the corrosion process and the iron carbide present in the steel.</li>
<li>Defects in tube manufacture, although far from being a regular occurrence, can be a cause of serious trouble. Lamination in boiler tubes or score marks arising from the cold drawing of tubes, give rise to premature failure and may promote corrosion at these regions.</li>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques434"><strong>Question 435. What Are The Causes Of Failure Of Superheater Tubes ?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Superheater tubes are subjected to the most severe combination of stress, temperature and corrosive environment. In addition to high-temperature strength, resistance to corrosion is also important. For example, low-alloy ferritic steel such as -1/% Cr, 1% Mo would not be used at metal temperatures above 580°C because of inadequate resistance to corrosion and oxidation over a full service life of 100,000/150,000 hr.</p>
<p>Failures in superheater tubes may arise from :</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Prior fabrication history</li>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Silicon contributes greatly to the production of sound steel because of its deoxidizing and degasifying properties. When added in amounts up to 2.5%, the ultimate strength of the steel is increased without loss in ductility. Silicon in excess of 2.5% causes brittleness, and amounts higher than 5% make the steel non-malleable.</p>
<p>Resistance to oxidation and surface stability of steel are increased by the addition of silicon. These desirable effects partially compensate for the tendency of silicon to lower the creep properties of steel.

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Some of the important cold drawing processes are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bar and Rod Drawing:</strong> In the case of bar drawing the hot drawn bars are at first pickled, washed and coated to prevent oxidation. Once this is done a draw bench is used for the process of cold drawing. In order to make an end possible to enter a drawing die the diameter of the rod is reduced by the swaging operation. This end is fastened by chains to the draw bench and the end is gripped by the jaws of the carriage. In this method a high surface finish and accuracy dimensionally is obtained. The products of this process can be used directly without any further machining.</li>
<li><strong>Wire Drawing: </strong>Similar to the above process the bars are first pickled, washed and coated to prevent any oxidation. After this the rods are passed through several dies of decreasing diameter to provide a desired reduction in the size ( diameter ). The dies used for the reduction process is generally made up of carbide materials.</li>

The two shafts are inclined at an angle and is constant. During motion it varies as the movement is transferred from one shaft to another. One of the major areas of application of this coupling is in gear boxes where the coupling is used to drive the rear wheels of trucks and other vehicles. In such usage scenarios two couplings are used each at the two ends of the coupling shaft. they are also used to transfer power for multiple drilling machines. The Hooke`s coupling is also known as the Universal coupling. The torque transmitted by the shafts is given by :</p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques593"><strong>Question 594. What Are The Basis On Which The Best Material For Sliding Contact Bearings Manufacturing?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Some of the important properties to lookout for in the material for sliding contact bearings are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compressive Strength: In order to prevent the permanent deformation and intrusion of the bearing the material selected should be possess a high compressive strength to bear the max bearing pressure.</li>
<li>Fatigue Strength: the material selected for the bearing should be able to withstand loads without any surface fatigue cracks getting created. This is only possible if the material has a high level of fatigue strength.</li>
<li>Comfortability: The material should be able to adjust or accommodate bearing inaccuracies and deflections without much wear and heating.</li>
<li>Embeddability: The material should allow the embedding of small particles without effecting the material of the journal.</li>
<li>Bondability: The bearings may be created by bringing together ( bonding ) multiple layers of the material. Due to the above reason the bondability of the material should be sufficiently high.</li>
<li>Thermal conductivity and corrosion resistance: Thermal conductivity is an essential property for bearing materials as it can help in quickly dissipating the generated heat. Also the material should have a level of corrosion resistance against the lubricant.</li>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques594"><strong>Question 595. Briefly Explain The Advantages Of Cycloidal And Involute Gears?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The advantages of the Cycloidal gears are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having a wider flank as compared to Involute gears they are considered to have more strength and hence can withstand further load and stress.</li>
<li>The contact in case of cycloidal gears is between the concave surface and the convex flank. This results in less wear and tear.</li>
<li>No interference occurs in these types of gears.</li>
</ul>
<p>The advantages of Involute gears are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The primary advantage of involute gears is that it allows the changing of the centre distance of a pair without changing the velocity ratio.</li>
<li>The pressure angle remains constant from start to end teeth, this results in less wear and smooth running of the gears.</li>
<li>The involute gears are easier to manufacture as they can be generated in a single curve ( the face and flank ).</li>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques595"><strong>Question 596. How Can The Reaction Of Support Of A Frame Be Evaluated?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Generally roller or hinged support are used to support the frames. The conditions of equilibrium are used to determine the reaction support of a frame. The condition of equilibrium takes place when the sum of the horizontal and vertical forces sum equal to zero. The system must form a state of equilibrium even after considering the external loads and the reactions at the supports. For equilibrium to be prevalent in the system the following conditions are required to be in occurrence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Summation of V = 0. This implies that the summation of all the forces in the vertical direction results to zero.</li>
<li>Summation of H = 0 . This implies that the total of all the forces acting in horizontal direction is also zero.</li>
<li>Summation of M = 0. The sum of all the moment of forces around a point must be zero.</li>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The steps required to calculate the force are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The reaction at the support has to be first calculated.</li>
<li>Once the reaction is calculated the direction of force of the member is made to make it tensile. On getting the result to be negative the direction assumed is wrong and this implies the force being compressive in nature.</li>
<li>A joint needs to be selected whose 2 members are not known. The lami`s theorem is used on the joint on which less than three forces are acting.</li>
<li>After the above process is complete the free body diagrams of the joint needs to be made. Since the system is in equilibrium the condition of Summation of V and H must result in zero.</li>
<li>After the above step the resolution of forces method needs to be used on the joint on which more than 4 forces are acting.</li>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques598"><strong>Question 599. What Are Bevel Gears And What Are Its Types?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Bevel gears are the type of gears in which the two shafts happen to intersect. The gear faces which are tooth bearing are conical in shape. They are generally mounted on shafts which are 90 degrees apart but they can be made to work at other angles as well. The bevel gears are classified into the following types on the basis of pitch surfaces and shaft angles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mitre Gears: These types of gears are similar to each other ie. they have the same pitch angles and contain the same number of teeth. The shaft axes intersect at 90 degrees angle.</li>
<li>Angular bevel gears: When two bevel gears connect at any angle apart from 90 degrees.</li>
<li>Crown bevel gears: When the two shaft axes intersect at an angle greater than 90 and one of the bevel gears have a pitch angle of 90 degrees they are known as crown bevel gears.</li>
<li>Internal bevel gears: In these type of gears the teeth on the gears is cut on the inside area of the pitch cone.</li>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques599"><strong>Question 600. What Are The Different Values That Need To Be Determined In Order To Design A Cylinder For An Ice?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The following values are needed to be determined:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thickness of the cylinder wall: The cylinder walls in an engine is made witness to gas pressure and the side thrust of a piston. This results in two types of stresses: longitudinal and circumferential stress. Both the types of stresses are perpendicular to each other and hence it is aimed to reduce the resulting stress as much as possible.</li>
<li>Length and bore of the cylinder: The length of the cylinder and the length of the stroke is calculated on the basis of the formula: length of cylinder L = 1.15 times the length of the stroke (l). L = 1.15(l)</li>
<li>Cylinder flange and studs: The cylinders are always cast integral as a part of the upper crankcase or in some cases attached to it by means of nuts and bolts. The flange is integral to a cylinder and henceforth its thickness should be greater than that of the cylinder wall. The thickness of flange should generally be between 1.2t-1.4t where t is the cylinder thickness. The stud diameter is calculated by equating gas load ( due to max pressure ) to the grand total of all the resisting forces of the studs.</li>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The piston head is designed on the basis of the following considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The crown should have enough strength to absorb the explosion pressure inside the engine cylinder.</li>
<li>The head must always dissipate the heat of the explosion as quickly as possible to the engine walls. The thickness of the head is calculated on the basis of another formula which takes into consideration the heat flowing through the head, the conductivity factor of the material. The temperature at the center and edges of the head.</li>
