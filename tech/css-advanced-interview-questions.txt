<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques2"><strong>Question 3. Is There Anything That Can T Be Replaced By Style Sheets?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Quite a bit actually. Style sheets only specify information that controls display and rendering information. Virtual style elements that convey the NATURE of the content can not be replaced by style sheets, and hyperlinking and multimedia object insertion is not a part of style sheet functionality at all (although controlling how those objects appear IS part of style sheets functionality.) The CSS1specification has gone out of its way to absorb ALL of the HTML functionality used in controlling display and layout characteristics. For more information on the possible properties in CSS, see the Index DOT Css Property Index.</p>
<p>Rule of Thumb: if an HTML element or attribute gives cues as to how its contentsshould be displayed, then some or all of its functionality has been absorbed by stylesheets.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques3"><strong>Question 4. How Can I Make A Page Look The Same In E.g. Ns And Msie ?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The simple answer is, you can't, and you shouldn't waste your time trying to make it exactly the same. Web browsers are allowed, per definition, to interpret a page as they like, subject to the general rules set down in the HTML and CSS specifications. As a web author you can not have a prior knowledge of the exact situation and/or medium that will be used to render your page, and it's almost always rather counterproductive to try to control that process. There is no necessity for a well-written page to look the same in different browsers. You may want to strive to ensure that it looks good in more than one browser, even if the actual display (in the case of graphical browsers) comes out a bit different. "Looking good" can be achieved by adopting sensible design and guidelines, such as not fixing the size or face of your fonts, not fixing the width of tables, etc… Don't fight the medium; most web users only use one browser and will never know, or bother to find out, that your page looks different, or even "better", in any other browser.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Pseudo-elements are fictional elements that do not exist in HTML. They address the element's sub-part (non-existent in HTML) and not the element itself. In CSS1 there are two pseudo-elements: 'first-line pseudo-element' and 'first-letter pseudo-element'. They can be attached to block-level elements (e.g. paragraphs or headings) to allow typographical styling of their sub-parts.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Many of the recent extensions to HTML have been tentative and somewhat crude attempts to control document layout. Style sheets go several steps beyond, and introduces complex border, margin and spacing control to most HTML elements. It also extends the capabilities introduced by most of the existing HTML browser extensions.

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques8"><strong>Question 9. Why Is My External Stylesheet Not Working ?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>There may be several different reasons behind that, but one very common mistake is to have an external stylesheet that contains HTML markup in some form.</p>
<p>An external stylesheet must contain only CSS rules, and if required, correctly formed CSS comments; never include any HTML syntax, such as &lt;style type="text/css"&gt;…</p>
<p>CSS comments are defined as anything that is placed between</p>
<p>/* (the comment start mark) and</p>
<p>*/ (the comment end mark). I.e. as follows…</p>
<p>/* This text right here is a correct CSS comment */</p>
<p>CSS comments may span multiple lines in the stylesheet. Nesting of CSS comments is not allowed.</p>
<p>Another reason for external stylesheets (and even embedded and inline stylerules) not to function as expected may be that you have tried to make use of some CSS-features that are not supported in the browser you are using.</p>
<p>External stylesheets shall also be served from the www-server with a MIME-type of 'text/css' in its 'Content Type:' HTTP header.</p>
<p>You may need to negotiate with your server admin to add this MIME type to your server if you are not able to configure the server yourself.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p><strong>There are different ways to apply CSS to a HTML document with a stylesheet, and these different ways can be combined:</strong></p>
<p><strong>*</strong> inline (internal) (Deprecated for XHTML)<br/>* embedded (internal)<br/>* linked (external) and<br/>* @import (external)</p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>No. Style sheets are case insensitive. Whatever is case insensitive in HTML is also case insensitive in CSS.

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques12"><strong>Question 13. What Is Cascade?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Cascade is a method of defining the weight (importance) of individual styling rules thus allowing conflicting rules to be sorted out should such rules apply to the sameselector.</p>
<p><strong>Declarations with increased weight take precedence over declaration with normal weight:</strong></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques13"><strong>Question 14. What Is Important Declaration?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Important declaration is a declaration with increased weight. Declaration with increased weight will override declarations with normal weight. If both reader's and author's style sheet contain statements with important declarations the author's declaration will override the reader's.</p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques14"><strong>Question 15. What Is Css Declaration?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>CSS declaration is style attached to a specific selector. It consists of two parts; property which is equivalent of HTML attribute, e.g. text-indent: and value which is equivalent of HTML value, e.g. 10pt. NOTE: properties are always ended with a colon.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques15"><strong>Question 16. What Is Class Selector?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Class selector is a "stand alone" class to which a specific style is declared. Using the CLASS attribute the declared style can then be associated with any HTML element. The class selectors are created by a period followed by the class's name. The name can contain characters a-z, A-Z, digits 0-9, period, hyphen, escaped characters, Unicode characters 161-255, as well as any Unicode character as a numeric code, however, they cannot start with a dash or a digit. (Note: in HTML the value of the CLASS attribute can contain more characters).It is a good practice to name classes according to their function than their appearance.</p>
<p>.footnote {font: 70%} /* class as selector */<br/>&lt;ADDRESS CLASS=footnote/&gt;This element is associated with the CLASS footnote&lt;/ADDRESS&gt;<br/>&lt;P CLASS=footnote&gt;And so is this&lt;/P&gt;</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques16"><strong>Question 17. What Is Selector?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>CSS selector is equivalent of HTML element(s). It is a string identifying to which element(s) the corresponding declaration(s) will apply and as such the link between the HTML document and the style sheet.</p>
<p>For example in P {text-indent: 10pt} the selector is P and is called type selector as it matches all instances of this element type in the document.</p>
<p>in P, UL {text-indent: 10pt} the selector is P and UL (see grouping); in .class {text-indent: 10pt} the selector is .class (see class selector).</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p><strong>There are two types of CSS rules:</strong></p>
<p>ruleset and at-rule. At-rule is a rule that applies to the whole style sheet and not to a specific selector only (like in ruleset). They all begin with the @ symbol followed by a keyword made up of letters a-z, A-Z, digits 0-9, dashes and escaped characters, e.g. @import or @font-face.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques18"><strong>Question 19. What Does The Cascading In Cascading Style Sheets Mean?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Style Sheets allow style information to be specified from many locations. Multiple (partial) external style sheets can be referenced to reduce redundancy, and both authors as well as readers can specify style preferences.</p>
<p>In addition, three main methods can be employed by an author to add style information to HTML documents, and multiple approaches for style control are available in each of these methods. In the end, style can be specified for a single element using any, or all, of these methods.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques19"><strong>Question 20. Why Use Style Sheets?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Style sheets allow a much greater degree of layout and display control than has ever been possible thus far in HTML. The amount of format coding necessary to control display characteristics can be greatly reduced through the use of external style sheets which can be used by a group of documents. Also, multiple style sheetscan be integrated from different sources to form a cohesive tapestry of styles for a document. Style sheets are also backward compatible - They can be mixed with HTML styling elements and attributes so that older browsers can view content as intended.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques20"><strong>Question 21. How Do I Get Rid Of The Gap Under My Image?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Images are inline elements, which means they are treated in the same way as text. Most people kind of know this - they know that if you use 'text-align:center' on an image it will be centred. What many people don't realise is that this means you will have a gap underneath an image. This gap is for the descenders of letters like j,q,p,y and g. To get rid of this gap you need to make the image block-level - like this :</p>
<p>CSS</p>
<p>img {display:block;}</p>
<p>One problem that this can cause is when you want to have a few images next to each other - if they are block-level, they won't be next to each other. To get around that, you can use float:left. Of course, this might present another problem - maybe you don't want the image to float left. In this case, you can use an unordered list like this :</p>
<p>CSS<br/>ul, li {<br/>list-style-type:none;<br/>padding:0;<br/>margin:0 auto;<br/>}<br/>ul {<br/>width:150px;<br/>}<br/>li {<br/>float:left;<br/>}<br/>HTML<br/>&lt;ul&gt;<br/>&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src="wine.jpg" height="50" width="50" alt="wine" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br/>&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src="wine.jpg" height="50" width="50" alt="wine" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br/>&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src="wine.jpg" height="50" width="50" alt="wine" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br/>&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src="wine.jpg" height="50" width="50" alt="wine" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br/>&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src="wine.jpg" height="50" width="50" alt="wine" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br/>&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src="wine.jpg" height="50" width="50" alt="wine" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br/>&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src="wine.jpg" height="50" width="50" alt="wine" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br/>&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src="wine.jpg" height="50" width="50" alt="wine" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br/>&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src="wine.jpg" height="50" width="50" alt="wine" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;<br/>&lt;/ul&gt;</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>&lt;font size="3"&gt;Welcome to my page&lt;/font&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Comment:</strong> The font-tag is design and design shouldn’t be in the HTML document. All design should be in the CSS-file! Instead do this:</p>
<p><strong>In the HTML:</strong></p>
<p>&lt;h1&gt;Welcome to my page&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
<p><strong>In the CSS:</strong></p>
<p>h1 { font-size: 2em; }</p>
<p><strong>One more example:</strong></p>
<p>&lt;b&gt;An error occurred&lt;/b&gt;</p>
<p>This looks right doesn’t it? But if you look up what &lt;b&gt; stands for you quickly find bold. But bold is certainly design, so it still doesn’t belong in the HTML document. A better choice is &lt;em&gt; that stands for emphasis or simply “this piece of text is important”. So instead of saying “this text looks like this” you are saying “this text is important” and you let the looks be decided by the CSS. Seems like a minor change, but it illustrates how to select your tags. Use this instead:</p>
<p><strong>In the HTML:</strong></p>
<p>&lt;em&gt;An error occured&lt;/em&gt;</p>
<p><strong>In the CSS:</strong></p>
<p>em {<br/>font-weight: bold;<br/>color: Red;<br/>}<br/><strong>One last example:</strong><br/>&lt;table&gt;<br/>&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;first link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;<br/>&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;second link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;<br/>...<br/>&lt;/table&gt;</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The idea here is that all sites contain two major parts, the content: all your articles, text and photos and the design: rounded corners, colors and effects. Usually those two are made in different parts of a webpage’s lifetime. The design is determined at the beginning and then you start filling it with content and keep the design fixed.</p>
<p>In CSS you just add the nifty &lt;link&gt;-tag I’ve told you about to the head of yourHTML document and you have created a link to your design. In the HTML documentyou put content only, and that link of yours makes sure it looks right. You can also use the exact same link on many of your pages, giving them all of them the same design. You want to add content? Just write a plain HTML document and think about marking things up like “header” instead of “big blue header” and use CSS to make all headers look the way you want!</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>With CSS, you can use the background-attachment property. The backgroundattachment can be included in the shorthand background property, as in this example:</p>
<p>body {<br/>background: white url(example.gif) fixed ;<br/>color: black ;<br/>}</p>
<p>Note that this CSS is supported by Internet Explorer, Mozilla, Firefox Opera, Safari, and other browsers. In contrast, Microsoft's proprietary BGPROPERTIES attribute is supported only by Internet Explorer.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques34"><strong>Question 35. What Is A Style Sheet?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Style sheets are the way that standards-compliant Web designers define the layout, look-and-feel, and design of their pages. They are called Cascading Style Sheets or CSS. With style sheets, a designer can define many aspects of a Web page:</p>
<p>* fonts<br/>* colors<br/>* layout<br/>* positioning<br/>* imagery<br/>* accessibility</p>
<p>Style sheets give you a lot of power to define how your pages will look. And another great thing about them is that style sheets make it really easy to update your pages when you want to make a new design. Simply load in a new style sheet onto your pages and you're done.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques36"><strong>Question 37. Why Do Style Sheets Exist?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>SGML (of which HTML is a derivative) was meant to be a device-independent method for conveying a document's structural and semantic content (its meaning.) It was never meant to convey physical formatting information. HTML has crossed this line and now contains many elements and attributes which specify visual style and formatting information. One of the main reasons for style sheets is to stop the creation of new HTML physical formatting constructs and once again separate style information from document content.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques38"><strong>Question 39. What Is Css Rule Ruleset?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>There are two types of CSS rules: ruleset and at-rule. Ruleset identifies selector orselectors and declares style which is to be attached to that selector or selectors. For example P {text-indent: 10pt} is a CSS rule. CSS rulesets consist of two parts:selector, e.g. P and declaration,</p>
<p>e.g. {text-indent: 10pt}.<br/>P {text-indent: 10pt} - CSS rule (ruleset)<br/>{text-indent: 10pt} - CSS declaration<br/>text-indent - CSS property<br/>10pt - CSS value</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques40"><strong>Question 41. What Is Id Selector?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>ID selector is an individually identified (named) selector to which a specific style is declared. Using the ID attribute the declared style can then be associated with one and only one HTML element per document as to differentiate it from all other elements. ID selectors are created by a character # followed by the selector's name. The name can contain characters a-z, A-Z, digits 0-9, period, hyphen, escaped characters, Unicode characters 161-255, as well as any Unicode characteras a numeric code, however, they cannot start with a dash or a digit.</p>
<p>#abc123 {color: red; background: black}</p>
<p>&lt;P ID=abc123&gt;This and only this element can be identified as abc123 &lt;/P&gt;</p></p>
