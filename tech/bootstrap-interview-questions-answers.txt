<p><strong>Ordered lists :</strong> An ordered list is a list that falls in some sort of sequential order and is prefaced by numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Unordered lists :</strong> An unordered list is a list that doesn't have any particular order and is traditionally styled with bullets. If you do not want the bullets to appear then you can remove the styling by using the class .list-unstyled. You can also place all list items on a single line using the class .list-inline.</p>
<p><strong>Definition lists :</strong> In this type of list, each list item can consist of both the &lt;dt&gt; and the &lt;dd&gt; elements. &lt;dt&gt; stands for definition term, and like a dictionary, this is the term (or phrase) that is being defined. Subsequently, the &lt;dd&gt; is the definition of the &lt;dt&gt;.</p>
<p>You can make terms and descriptions in &lt;dl&gt; line up side-by-side using class dl-horizontal.</p></p>
