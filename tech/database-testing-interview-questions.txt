<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>After execution of the test in terms of finding the defect that has been already detected and fixed. Re-execution of the same test with different input values to confirm the original defect has been successfully removed is called Re-testing or confirmation Testing.</p>
<p>Retesting is also called Data Driven Testing, but the difference between both is,</p>
<p><strong>Retesting:-</strong> It is a manual testing process whereas application testing done with entire new set of data.</p>
<p><strong>DataDriven Testing(DDT):-</strong>It is an Automation testing process where application will be tested with multiple test data.It is simple and easy than retesting where tester just sit in front of system and enter different new input valuesmanually from front-end interface, it is really boring technique.</p></p>

<li>You need to Open corresponding DTS package in SQL Enterprise Manager and run the DTS package (If you are using SQL Server).</li>
<li>Then you need to compare the column’s data of Source and the Target.</li>
<li>You have to check the number to rows of Source and Target.</li>
<li>After updating data in the Source database, you need to check whether the changes have been reflected on destination database or not.</li>
