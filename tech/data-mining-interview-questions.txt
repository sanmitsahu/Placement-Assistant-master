<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques1"><strong>Question 2. Differentiate Between Data Mining And Data Warehousing? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Data warehousing is merely extracting data from different sources, cleaning the data and storing it in the warehouse. Where as data mining aims to examine or explore the data using queries. These queries can be fired on the data warehouse. Explore the data in data mining helps in reporting, planning strategies, finding meaningful patterns etc.</p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques31"><strong>Question 32. What Is Spatial Data Mining?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Spatial data mining is the application of data mining methods to spatial data. Spatial data mining follows along the same functions in data mining, with the end objective to find patterns in geography. So far, data mining and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have existed as two separate technologies, each with its own methods, traditions and approaches to visualization and data analysis. Particularly, most contemporary GIS have only very basic spatial analysis functionality. The immense explosion in geographically referenced data occasioned by developments in IT, digital mapping, remote sensing, and the global diffusion of GIS emphasises the importance of developing data driven inductive approaches to geographical analysis and modeling.</p>
<p>Data mining, which is the partially automated search for hidden patterns in large databases, offers great potential benefits for applied GIS-based decision-making. Recently, the task of integrating these two technologies has become critical, especially as various public and private sector organizations possessing huge databases with thematic and geographically referenced data begin to realise the huge potential of the information hidden there. Among those organizations are:</p>
<p>* offices requiring analysis or dissemination of geo-referenced statistical data<br/>
* public health services searching for explanations of disease clusters<br/>
* environmental agencies assessing the impact of changing land-use patterns on climate change<br/>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Regression can be used to solve the classification problems but it can also be used for applications such as forecasting. Regression can be performed using many different types of techniques; in actually regression takes a set of data and fits the data to a formula.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Dimensional Modelling is a design concept used by many data warehouse desginers to build thier data warehouse. In this design model all the data is stored in two types of tables - Facts table and Dimension table. Fact table contains the facts/measurements of the business and the dimension table contains the context of measuremnets ie, the dimensions on which the facts are calculated.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques55"><strong>Question 56. What Are The Foundations Of Data Mining? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Data mining techniques are the result of a long process of research and product development. This evolution began when business data was first stored on computers, continued with improvements in data access, and more recently, generated technologies that allow users to navigate through their data in real time. Data mining takes this evolutionary process beyond retrospective data access and navigation to prospective and proactive information delivery. Data mining is ready for application in the business community because it is supported by three technologies that are now sufficiently mature:<br/>
* Massive data collection<br/>
* Powerful multiprocessor computers<br/>
* Data mining algorithms</p>
<p>Commercial databases are growing at unprecedented rates. A recent META Group survey of data warehouse projects found that 19% of respondents are beyond the 50 gigabyte level, while 59% expect to be there by second quarter of 1996.1 In some industries, such as retail, these numbers can be much larger. The accompanying need for improved computational engines can now be met in a cost-effective manner with parallel multiprocessor computer technology. Data mining algorithms embody techniques that have existed for at least 10 years, but have only recently been implemented as mature, reliable, understandable tools that consistently outperform older statistical methods.</p></p>

<p>ETL provide developers with an interface for designing source-to-target mappings, ransformation and job control parameter.<br/>
*Extraction<br/>
Take data from an external source and move it to the warehouse pre-processor database.<br/>
*Transformation<br/>
Transform data task allows point-to-point generating, modifying and transforming data.<br/>
*Loading<br/>
Load data task adds records to a database table in a warehouse.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Custom rollup operators provide a simple way of controlling the process of rolling up a member to its parents values.The rollup uses the contents of the column as custom rollup operator for each member and is used to evaluate the value of the member’s parents.</p>
<p>If a cube has multiple custom rollup formulas and custom rollup members, then the formulas are resolved in the order in which the dimensions have been added to the cube.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques63"><strong>Question 64. What Are Different Stages Of "data Mining"?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Exploration: This stage involves preparation and collection of data. it also involves data cleaning, transformation. Based on size of data, different tools to analyze the data may be required. This stage helps to determine different variables of the data to determine their behavior.</p>
<p>Model building and validation: This stage involves choosing the best model based on their predictive performance. The model is then applied on the different data sets and compared for best performance. This stage is also called as pattern identification. This stage is a little complex because it involves choosing the best pattern to allow easy predictions.</p>
<p>Deployment: Based on model selected in previous stage, it is applied to the data sets. This is to generate predictions or estimates of the expected outcome.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Data mining extension is based on the syntax of SQL. It is based on relational concepts and mainly used to create and manage the data mining models. DMX comprises of two types of statements: Data definition and Data manipulation. Data definition is used to define or create new models, structures.</p>
<p>Example:<br/>
CREATE MINING SRUCTURE<br/>
CREATE MINING MODEL</p>
<p>Data manipulation is used to manage the existing models and structures.</p>
<p>Example:<br/>
