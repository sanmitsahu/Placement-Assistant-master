<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques9"><strong>Question 10. What Is A Rectifier?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A rectifier changes alternating current into direct current. This process is called rectification. The three main types of rectifier are the half­wave, full­wave, and bridge. A rectifier is the opposite of an inverter, which changes direct current into alternating current. HWR­ The simplest type is the half­wave rectifier, which can be made with just one diode. When the voltage of the alternating current is positive, the diode becomes forwardbiased and current flows through it. When the voltage is negative, the diode is reverse­biased and the current stops.</p>
<p>The result is a clipped copy of the alternating current waveform with only positive voltage, and an average voltage that is one third of the peak input voltage. This pulsating direct current is adequate for some components, but others require a more steady current. This requires a full­wave rectifier that can convert both parts of the cycle to positive voltage.</p>
<p>FWR­ The full­wave rectifier is essentially two half­wave rectifiers, and can be made with two diodes and an earthed centre tap on the transformer. The positive voltage half of the cycle flows through one diode, and the negative half flows through the other. The centre tap allows the circuit to be completed because current cannot flow through the other diode. The result is still a pulsating direct current but with just over half the input peak voltage, and double the frequency.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Much attention has been given by researchers to negative feedback processes, because negative feedback processes lead systems towards equilibrium states.

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques16"><strong>Question 17. What Is A Feedback? And Explain Different Types Of Feedback.</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Feedback is a process whereby some proportion of the output signal of a system is passed (fed back) to the input. This is often used to control the dynamic behaviour of the system.</p>
<p><strong>Types of feedback:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Negative feedback:</strong> This tends to reduce output (but in amplifiers, stabilizes and linearizes operation). Negative feedback feeds part of a system’s output, inverted, into the system’s input; generally with the result that fluctuations are attenuated.</p>
<p><strong>Positive feedback:</strong> This tends to increase output. Positive feedback, sometimes referred to as “cumulative causation”, is a feedback loop system in which the system responds to perturbation (Aperturbation means a system, is an alteration of function, induced by external or internal mechanisms) in the same direction as the perturbation. In contrast, a system that responds to the perturbation in the opposite direction is called a negative feedback system. </p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques17"><strong>Question 18. Explain Full Duplex And Half Duplex.</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Full duplex refers to the transmission of data in two directions simultaneously. For example, a telephone is a full­duplex devicebecause both parties can talk at once. In contrast, a walkie­talkie is ahalf­duplex device because only one party can transmit at a time. Most modems have a switch that lets you choose between full­duplex and half­duplex modes. The choice depends on whichcommunications program you are running.</p>
<p>In full­duplex mode, data you transmit does not appear on yourscreen until it has been received and sent back by the other party. This enables you to validate that the data has been accurately transmitted. If your display screen shows two of each character, it probably means that your modem is set to half­duplex mode when it should be in full­duplex mode.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques20"><strong>Question 21. Difference Between Cdma And Gsm.</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>These are the two different means of mobile communication being presently used worldwide. The basic difference lies in the Multiplexing method used in the aerial communication i.e. from Mobile Tower to your mobile and vice versa. CDMA uses Code Division Multiple Access as the name itself indicates, for example you are in a hall occupied with number of people speaking different language.</p>
<p>You will find that the one  language you know will be heard by you and the others will be treated like noise. In the same manner each CDMA mobile communication takes place with a “code” communicating between them and the other end if one is knowing that code then only it can listen to the data being transmitted i.e. the communication is in the coded form.</p>
<p>On the other hand GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications)uses narrowband TDMA, which allows eight simultaneous calls on the same radio frequency. TDMA works by dividing a radio frequency into time slots and then allocating slots to multiple calls. In this way, a single frequency can support multiple, simultaneous data channels.</p></p>
</li><br><br><li class="quesans mb-20">
<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques21"><strong>Question 22. What Is Cdma, Tdma, Fdma?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Code division multiple access (CDMA) is a channel access methodutilized by various radio communication technologies. CDMA employsspread­spectrum technology and a special coding scheme (where each transmitter is assigned a code) to allow multiple users to be multiplexed over the same physical channel. By contrast, time division multiple access (TDMA) divides access by time, whilefrequency­division multiple access (FDMA) divides it byfrequency.</p>
<p>An analogy to the problem of multiple access is a room (channel) in which people wish to communicate with each other. To avoid confusion, people could take turns speaking (time division), speak at different pitches (frequency division), or speak in different directions (spatial division). </p>
<p>In CDMA, they would speak different languages. People speaking the same language can understand each other, but not other people. Similarly, in radio CDMA, each group of users is given a shared code. Many codes occupy the same channel, but only users associated with a particular code can understand each other.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques27"><strong>Question 28. How Does A Mobile Work?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>When you talk into a mobile telephone it converts the sound of your voice to radiofrequency energy (radio waves). The radio waves are transmitted through the air to a nearby base station. The base station then sends the call through the telephone network until it reaches the person you are calling. When you receive a call on your mobile phone the message travels through the telephone network until it reaches a base station near to you. The base station sends out radio waves, which are detected by your telephone and converted back to speech. Depending on the equipment and the operator, the frequency that each operator utilises is 900MHz, 1800MHz or 2100MHz.</p>
<p>The mobile phone network operates on the basis of a series of cells. Each cell requires a radio base station to enable it to function.</p>
<p><strong>There are three types of base station and each has a particular purpose:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The Macrocell is the largest type and provides the main coverage for mobile phone networks.</li>
<li>The Microcell is used to improve capacity in areas where demand to make calls is high, such as shopping centres.</li>
<li>The Picocell only has a range of a few hundred metres and may be used to boost weak signals within large buildings.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each base station can only cope with a certain number of calls at any one time. So if demand exceeds the capacity of a base station an additional base station is needed.</p></p>
