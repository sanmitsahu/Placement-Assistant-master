<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques2"><strong>Question 3. Explain About Write Ahead Logging?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>This feature increases the reliability of the database by logging changes before any changes or updations to the data base. This provides log of database incase of a database crash. This helps to start the work from the point it was discontinued.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques3"><strong>Question 4. Explain About Multi Version Concurrency Control?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Multi version concurrency control or MVCC is used to avoid unnecessary locking of the database. This removes the time lag for the user to log into his database. This feature or time lag occurs when some one else is on the content. All the transactions are kept as a record.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques9"><strong>Question 10. Explain About Functions In Postgresql?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Functions are important because they help the code to be executed on the server. Some of the languages which can program functions for efficient use are PL/pgSQL which is the native language of PostgreSQL.

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques25"><strong>Question 26. What Is A Ctid?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>CTIDs identify specific physical rows by their block and offset positions within a table. They are used by index entries to point to physical rows. A logical row's CTID changes when it is updated, so the CTID cannot be used as a long-term row identifier. But it is sometimes useful to identify a row within a transaction when no competing update is expected.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>There is no way to query a database other than the current one. Because PostgreSQL loads database-specific system catalogs, it is uncertain how a cross-database query should even behave.<br/>contrib/dblink allows cross-database queries using function calls. Of course, a client can also make simultaneous connections to different databases and merge the results on the client side.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The term “NoSQL” covers such a diverse array of non-relational database implementations … from tiny embedded databases like TokyoCabinet to massive clustered data processing platforms like Hadoop … that it’s impossible to comment on them as a general class. Non-relational databases preceded relational databases and have existed alongside them for forty years, so choosing between relational and nonrelational databases is nothing new. Users should choose the database whose features, implementation, and community support their current application needs. Further, using multiple different databases for large projects is fast becoming the norm, and PostgreSQL users are no exception.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Our feature set is generally considered to be very competitive with other leading SQL RDBMSes. Certainly there are features some of them have which we don’t, and the reverse is also true. To date, only a few benchmarks have been published showing PostgreSQL to be within 10-30% of proprietary competitors. However, we have had many users migrate from other database systems ï¿½ primarily Oracle and Informix ï¿½ and they are completely satisfied with the performance of their PostgreSQL systems.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>This is a topic that can start several hours of discussion. As a quick summary, MySQL is the “easy-to-use, web developer” database, and PostgreSQL is the “feature-rich, standards-compliant” database. PostgreSQL is liberally licensed and owned by its community; MySQL is GPL-licensed and owned by Oracle. Beyond that, each database user should make his own evaluation; open source software makes doing comparisons very easy.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Multi version concurrency control is used to manage concurrency. This feature is very useful because changes made in the database will not be visible to other users until the transaction is completed. This removes the need for read locks. ACID principles are given a further boost by this feature and can be implemented in general.</p></p>
