<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p><strong>There are two methods of dimensioning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unidirectional system: All the dimensions are placed in one direction only. These are normally put from left to right whether written on a horizontal/vertical/inclined dimension.</li>
<li>Aligned system: The dimensions are placed perpendicular to the dimension line. On a horizontal dimension, it is horizontal while on a vertical dimension, it is in the vertical direction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aligned system of dimensioning is more common.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p><strong>Different styles of scales are:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Plain scale:</strong> In which, one can measure certain units and its one tenth value. For example a scale in cm and mm is a plain scale, m and dm is another plain scale.</p>
<p><strong>Diagonal scale:</strong> In which, one can measure certain units, its one tenth value as well as its one hundredth value. For example a scale in m, dm and cm is a diagonal scale, dm, and cm and mm is another diagonal scale.</p>
<p><strong>Comparative or Corresponding scale:</strong> These are two different scales having same R.F. but different units. These can be placed side by side or placed over one and another.</p>
<p><strong>For example:</strong> in miles and kilometres.</p>
<p>These scales can be plain scales or diagonal scales.</p>
<p><strong>Vernier scales:</strong> It is a scale which is extremely accurate for measurement. It uses a Vernier calliper. Vernier calliper is an instrument to measure a dimension very precisely. Normally its least count is 1/100 of the scale unit. Say a scale is in cm, then a Vernier can measure very accurately up to 1/100 of a cm i.e. 2.12 cm.</p></p>

<p>Units are m and dm.</p>
<p>F. = 2/100=1/50</p>
