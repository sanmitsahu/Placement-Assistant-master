<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The transaction is referred as a unit of work that is performed against a database. It is the propagation of one or more changes to the database. Properties of transactions are determined by ACID.</p>
<ul>
<li>Atomicity: It ensures that all work unit are successfully completed.</li>
<li>Consistency: It ensures that the database changes states upon a successfully committed transaction.</li>
<li>Isolation: It enables transactions to operate independently of and transparent to each other.</li>
<li>Durability: It ensures that the result or effect of a committed transaction persists in case of a system failure.</li>
