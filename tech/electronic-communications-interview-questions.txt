<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Handover in mobile communication refers to the process of transferring a call from one network cell to another without breaking the call.</p>
<p>There are two types of handover which are as follows :</p>
<p><strong>Hard Handoff :</strong> hard handoff is the process in which the cell connection is disconnected from the previous cell before it is made with the new one.</p>
<p><strong>Soft Handoff :</strong> It is the process in which a new connection is established first before disconnecting the old one. It is thus more efficient and smart.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques2"><strong>Question 3. What Is Ionospheric Bending?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>When a radio wave travels into the ionospheric layer it experiences refraction due to difference in density. The density of ionospheric layer is rarer than the layer below which causes the radio wave to be bent away from the normal. Also the radio wave experiences a force from the ions in the ionospheric layer. If incident at the correct angle the radio wave is completely reflected back to the inner atmosphere due to total internal reflection. This phenomenon is called ionospheric reflection and is used in mobile communication for radio wave propagation also known as ionospheric bending of radio waves.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques3"><strong>Question 4. What Is Cdma?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>CDMA stands for Code Division Multiple Access which uses digital format. In CDMA systems several transmissions via the radio interface take place simultaneously on the same frequency bandwidth. User data is combined at the transmitter’s side with a code, then transmitted. On air, all transmission get mixed. At the receiver's side the same code is used as in the transmitter’s side. The code helps the receiver to filter the user information of the transmitter from incoming mixture of all transmissions on the same frequency band and same time.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The whole of the geographical area is divided into hexagonal shape geometrical area called cell and each cell having its own transceiver. Each BTS (cell site) allocated different band of frequency or different channel. Each BTS antenna is designed in such a way that i cover cell area in which it is placed with frequency allotted without interfering other cell signals. The design process of selecting and allocating channel groups for all of the cellular base station within system is called frequency reuse.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Bluetooth is designed to be a personal area network, where participating entities are mobile and require sporadic communication with others. It is omni directional i.e. it does not have line of sight limitation like infra red does. Ericsson started the work on Bluetooth and named it after the Danish king Harold Biuetooth. Bluetooth operates in the 2.4 GHz area of spectrum and provides a range of 10 metres. It offers transfer speeds of around 720 Kbps.</p></p>

<ol>
<li>PTP ( Point to point)</li>

<p>Some of the GPRS services are not likely to be provided by network operators during early deployment of GPRS due in part to the phased development of standard. Market demand is another factor affecting the decision of operators regarding which services to offer first.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques7"><strong>Question 8. What Are The Advantages Of Cdma?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Advantages of CDMA are as follows :</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Frequency diversity</strong> : Transmission is spread out over a large bandwidth due to that less affected by noise. If bandwidth is increased S/N ratio increases, which means noise will be reduced.</li>
<li><strong>Multiplication Resistance</strong> : Chipping codes used for CDMA not only exhibit low correlation but also low autocorrelation. Hence a version of the signal that is delayed by more than one chip interval does not interfere with dominant signal as in other multipath environments.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong> : Due to spread spectrum is obtained by the use of noise like signals, where each user has a unique code, so privacy is inherent.</li>
<li><strong>Graceful Degradation</strong> : In CDMA, more users access the system simultaneously as compared to FDMa, TDMA.</li>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Once the signal is coded, modulated and then sent, the receiver must demodulate the signal. This is usually done in two steps :</p>
<ol>

<li>The remaining information bearing signal is demodulated by multiplying with a local reference identical in structure and synchronised with received signal.</li>

<ol>
<li>The codes do not have a single, narrow autocorrelation peak.</li>
<li>The spreading is not over the whole bandwidth; instead the energy is spread over a number of discrete frequency components.</li>
<li>Although the full sequence cross correlation is identically zero, this does not hold for a partial sequence cross correlation function. Thus advantage of using orthogonal codes is lost.</li>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p><strong>Building penetration:</strong> Building penetration depends on the material used for construction and architecture used. This varies building to building and is based on building construction.</p>
<p><strong>Building Height Effect:</strong> The signal strength is always higher at top floor and generally floor gain height is about 2.7dB/floor which is not dependent on building construction.</p>
<p><strong>Building Floor Reception:</strong> The signal isolation between floors in a multi floor building is on the average about 20dB. Within a floor of 150 * 150 feet, the propagation loss due to interior walls, depending on the wall materials is about 20 dB between the strong and the weak areas.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>While both provide backup power during mains outage, with the UPS the switch is instantaneous whereas with the Inverter there is a gap of a second or two. This gap is OK for household gadgets such as lights, fans, fridge, etc. but not OK for computers.</p>
<p>In technical terms:</p>
<p><strong>UPS:</strong> The mains power comes to the UPS. The AC is converted to DC and this DC is constantly charging the battery. The output of the battery is fed to the Sine wave inverter and it converts DC to AC and this feeds the equipment. Since power out is always drawn from the battery, there is no time lag when mains swicthes off; it justs stops the battery from being charged and the UPS continues to supply power till the battery runs out.</p>
<p><strong>Inverter:</strong> The mains power comes to the Inverter. This is directly sent to the output but the AC is also converted to DC and this DC is constantly charging the battery. A sensor and relay mechanism checks whether the mains is ON or OFF.</p>
<p>When the main switches OFF, the relay actuator triggers to switch from mains to inverter. Rest is same like the UPS. Because of this sensor and relay, there is a gap between triggering.</p>
<p>UPS involves more costly circuitary and is therefor more expensive to make and sell.</p></p>
