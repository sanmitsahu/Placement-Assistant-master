<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques0"><strong>Question 1. What's Mysql ?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>MySQL (pronounced "my ess cue el") is an open source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL), the most popular language for adding, accessing, and processing data in a database. Because it is open source, anyone can download MySQL and tailor it to their needs in accordance with the general public license. MySQL is noted mainly for its speed, reliability, and flexibility.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques1"><strong>Question 2. What Is Ddl, Dml And Dcl ?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>If you look at the large variety of SQL commands, they can be divided into three large subgroups. Data Definition Language deals with database schemas and descriptions of how the data should reside in the database, therefore language statements like CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE belong to DDL. DML deals with data manipulation, and therefore includes most common SQL statements such SELECT, INSERT, etc. Data Control Language includes commands such as GRANT, and mostly concerns with rights, permissions and other controls of the database system.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Use DISTINCT in the query, such as SELECT DISTINCT user_firstname FROM users; You can also ask for a number of distinct values by saying SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT user_firstname) FROM users;</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS page_title FROM web_pages LIMIT 1,10; SELECT FOUND_ROWS(); The second query (not that COUNT() is never used) will tell you how many results there’re total, so you can display a phrase "Found 13,450,600 results, displaying 1-10". Note that FOUND_ROWS does not pay attention to the LIMITs you specified and always returns the total number of rows affected by query.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>What it means is that so of the data that you’re trying to delete is still alive in another table. Like if you have a table for universities and a table for students, which contains the ID of the university they go to, running a delete on a university table will fail if the students table still contains people enrolled at that university. Proper way to do it would be to delete the offending data first, and then delete the university in question. Quick way would involve running SET foreign_key_checks=0 before the DELETE command, and setting the parameter back to 1 after the DELETE is done. If your foreign key was formulated with ON DELETE CASCADE, the data in dependent tables will be removed automatically.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A database is a structured collection of data. It may be anything from a simple shopping list to a picture gallery or the vast amounts of information in a corporate network. To add, access, and process data stored in a computer database, you need a database management system such as MySQL. Since computers are very good at handling large amounts of data, database management plays a central role in computing, as stand-alone utilities, or as parts of other applications.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques63"><strong>Question 64. Why Use Mysql?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>MySQL is very fast, reliable, and easy to use. If that is what you are looking for, you should give it a try. MySQL also has a very practical set of features developed in very close cooperation with our users. You can find a performance comparison of MySQL to some other database managers on our benchmark page. See section 12.7 Using Your Own Benchmarks. MySQL was originally developed to handle very large databases much faster than existing solutions and has been successfully used in highly demanding production environments for several years. Though under constant development,  MySQL today offers a rich and very useful set of functions. The connectivity, speed, and security make MySQL highly suited for accessing databases on the Internet.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques64"><strong>Question 65. How Mysql Optimizes Distinct ?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>DISTINCT is converted to a GROUP BY on all columns, DISTINCT combined with ORDER BY will in many cases also need a temporary table.</p>
<p>When combining LIMIT # with DISTINCT, MySQL will stop as soon as it finds # unique rows.</p>
<p>If you don't use columns from all used tables, MySQL will stop the scanning of the not used tables as soon as it has found the first match.</p>
<pre>
SELECT DISTINCT t1.a FROM t1,t2 where t1.a=t2.a;</pre>
<p>In the case, assuming t1 is used before t2 (check with EXPLAIN), then MySQL will stop reading from t2 (for that particular row in t1) when the first row in t2 is found.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques65"><strong>Question 66. How Mysql Optimizes Limit ?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>In some cases MySQL will handle the query differently when you are using LIMIT # and not using HAVING:</p>
<p>If you are selecting only a few rows with LIMIT, MySQL will use indexes in some cases when it normally would prefer to do a full table scan.</p>
<p>If you use LIMIT # with ORDER BY, MySQL will end the sorting as soon as it has found the first # lines instead of sorting the whole table.</p>
<p>When combining LIMIT # with DISTINCT, MySQL will stop as soon as it finds # unique rows.</p>
<p>In some cases a GROUP BY can be resolved by reading the key in order (or do a sort on the key) and then calculate summaries until the key value changes. In this case LIMIT # will not calculate any unnecessary GROUP BY's.</p>
<p>As soon as MySQL has sent the first # rows to the client, it will abort the query.</p>
<p>LIMIT 0 will always quickly return an empty set. This is useful to check the query and to get the column types of the result columns.</p>
<p>The size of temporary tables uses the LIMIT # to calculate how much space is needed to resolve the query.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>If you want to delete all rows in the table, you should use TRUNCATE TABLE table_name. The time to delete a record is exactly proportional to the number of indexes. To delete records more quickly, you can increase the size of the index cache.</p></p>
