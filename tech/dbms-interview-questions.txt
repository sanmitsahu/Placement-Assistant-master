The most important of these are the database files where the actual data resides. The control files and the redo logs support the functioning of the architecture itself. All three sets of files must be present, open, and available to Oracle for any data on the database to be useable. Without these files, you cannot access the database, and the database administrator might have to recover some or all of the database using a backup, if there is one.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>1. Cold Backup: It is copying the three sets of files (database files, redo logs, and control file) when the instance is shut down. This is a straight file copy, usually from the disk directly to tape. You must shut down the instance to guarantee a consistent copy. If a cold backup is performed, the only option available in   the event of data file loss is restoring all the flies from the latest backup. All work performed on the database since the last backup is lost. <br/>
2. Hot Backup: Some sites (such as worldwide airline reservations systems) cannot shut down the database while making a backup copy of the files. The cold backup is not an available option.  What is meant by Proactive, Retroactive and Simultaneous Update.  Proactive Update: The updates that are applied to database before it becomes effective in real world. Retroactive Update: The updates that are applied to database after it becomes effective in real world. Simultaneous Update: The updates that are applied to database at the same time when it becomes effective in real world.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A foreign key is used to establish relationships among relations in the relational model. Technically, a foreign key is a column (or columns) appearing in one relation that is (are) the primary key of another table. Although there may be exceptions, the values in the foreign key columns usually must correspond to values existing in the set of primary key values. This correspondence requirement is created in a database using a referential integrity constraint on the foreign key.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques70"><strong>Question 71. What Are Insertion And Deletion Anomalies? </strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A deletion anomaly occurs when, by deleting the facts about one entity, we in advertently delete facts about another entity; with one deletion, we lose facts about two entities. For example, if we delete the tuple for Student 001289 from a table, we may lose not only the fact that Student 001289 is in Pierce Hall, but also the fact that he has $200 left in his security deposit. An insertion anomaly happens when we encounter the restriction that we cannot insert a fact about one entity until we have an additional fact about another entity. For example, we want to store the fact that the security deposit for Pierce Hall is $300, but we cannot enter this data into the Student relation until a student registers for Pierce Hall.</p></p>

A surrogate key is a unique, DBMS-supplied identifier intended to be used as the primary key of a table. Further, the DBMS will not allow the value of a surrogate key to be changed. The values of a surrogate key have no meaning to the users and are usually hidden on forms and reports.

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A recursive relationship is a relationship among entities of the same class, and is represented in the same way as other relationships are. The rows of the tables can take two different roles, however. Some are parent rows, and others are child rows. Further, the table will contain both its own primary key and the foreign key that links back to the table itself. If a row has no parent, then the value of the foreign key column in that row will be null. If the row has a parent, then there must be a foreign key value in that row that corresponds to the primary key value of another row in the table.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques169"><strong>Question 170. What Is A View? How It Is Related To Data Independence?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>A view may be thought of as a virtual table, that is, a table that does not really exist in its own right but is instead derived from one or more underlying base table. In other words, there is no stored file that direct represents the view instead a definition of view is stored in data dictionary. Growth and restructuring of base tables is not reflected in views. Thus the view can insulate users from the effects of restructuring and growth in the database. Hence accounts for logical data independence.</p></p>

<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Along with the RDBMS software, Oracle provides two utilities that you can use to back up and restore the database. These utilities are Export and Import.</p>
<p>The Export utility dumps the definitions and data for the specified part of the database to an operating system binary file. The Import utility reads the file produced by an export, recreates the definitions of objects, and inserts the data.</p>
<p>If Export and Import are used as a means of backing up and recovering the database, all the changes made to the database cannot be recovered since the export was performed. The best you can do is recover the database to the time when the export was last performed.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques187"><strong>Question 188. What Is Oracle Block? Can Two Oracle Blocks Have The Same Address?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>Oracle "formats" the database files into a number of Oracle blocks when they are first created—making it easier for the RDBMS software to manage the files and easier to read data into the memory areas.</p>
<p>The block size should be a multiple of the operating system block size. Regardless of the block size, the entire block is not available for holding data; Oracle takes up some space to manage the contents of the block. This block header has a minimum size, but it can grow. These Oracle blocks are the smallest unit of storage. Increasing the Oracle block size can improve performance, but it should be done only when the database is first created. Each Oracle block is numbered sequentially for each database file starting at 1. Two blocks can have the same block address if they are in different database files.</p></p>

<p><a class="accordion-trigger ques" id="ques188"><strong>Question 189. What Is Rowid?</strong></a></p>
<p><span class="ans"><strong>Answer :</strong></span><p>The ROWID is a unique database-wide physical address for every row on every table. Once assigned (when the row is first inserted into the database), it never changes until the row is deleted or the table is dropped.<br/>
The ROWID consists of the following three components, the combination of which uniquely identifies the physical storage location of the row.<br/>
• Oracle database file number, which contains the block with the rows<br/>
• Oracle block address, which contains the row<br/>
• The row within the block (because each block can hold many rows) <br/>
The ROWID is used internally in indexes as a quick means of retrieving rows with a particular key value. Application developers also use it in SQL statements as a quick way to access a row once they know the ROWID.</p></p>

<p>The most important of these are the database files where the actual data resides. The control files and the redo logs support the functioning of the architecture itself.</p>
